   "Abstract": "\"In this paper the author introduces a very practical model to guide school leaders/managers into supporting parental -involvement and -engagement in their schools. The model is called the Dual Navigation Approach (DNA). This rubric is based on six meta-analyses that he conducted over the last fifteen years. What is presented therefore is a data based paradigm of parental –involvement and -engagement, which will help school leaders and managers understand what how these programmes in their schools can become considerably enhanced. The DNA model more fully distinguishes and develops the two primary branches of parental -involvement and -engagement, i.e. the schoolbased component and the home-based aspects. According to the author, when these two components of parental – involvement and -engagement work together student education outcomes can be greatly enhanced. The practical significance of these findings is discussed.\"",

   "Abstract": "\"Interventions training parents of at-risk children have received considerable empirical support but their effectiveness is undermined by low attendance rates. This research sought to clarify why parents, even with the best of intentions, fail to follow through to full participation in workshop programs; and to provide insight into ways to improve parental engagement. We examined participation in Parents as Partners, a school-based, early childhood intervention. Demographic and ongoing educational, social, emotional and behavioural data for 136 parent–child dyads were gathered from parents, teachers and children. Mitigation of a wide range of factors previously identiﬁed as barriers to attendance was also attempted. A postintervention survey was conducted to examine parents’ insights into their attendance patterns. Overall, 91 parents attended and 44 failed to attend any workshops. Higher parent education and SEI, and better child language skills were good predictors of attendance (87%), but poor predictors of nonattendance (42%). Additionally, parent-child dyad proﬁles suggested that children of nonattending parents were more likely to beneﬁt from workshop content than attenders’ children. Survey data suggested that attenders organised their schedules to facilitate follow-through but nonattenders were unable to do so. Family characteristics and practical reasons were central, interacting factors affecting attendance. Parental self-organisation appeared to moderate follow-through and to stem from lifestyle constraints related to lower SEI and parent education. This produced high nonattendance rates in parents of children who most needed support. It is urgent to discover to what extent innovative delivery platforms currently being explored (e.g., internet/social media) can improve parental engagement.\"",

In tandem with this, it was important to discover how accurately we could predict parents who were more likely to follow through to attendance at training (i.e., using within-parent and/or parent-child dyad characteristics). Secondly, we examined attendance as a factor of workshop characteristics and participation demands, including whether parents were more likely to follow through to attendance if training workshops were offered when their child was in Kindergarten (i.e., 4-years old) or Pre-primary (5years old); whether they would show different patterns of follow-through according to program type (i.e., workshops targeting language and literacy vs social, emotional and behavioural skills); and how follow-through for workshop attendance compared with persistence in the three other forms of parental participation in PasP (i.e., parents’ postintervention PA testing; completion of questionnaires; and continued support of their child’s participation through to the end of Grade 2).

Overall, this suggests that the motivation to move from intention to action was not related to parents’ actual or perceived strengths or weaknesses relevant to the content of either workshop type\" (p. 263). \" Our parent questionnaire data suggest that the apparent moderating effect of organisation may be due to lifestyle constraints stemming from two other signiﬁcant family characteristics of nonattenders: That is, less well-educated parents with lower socio-economic levels may have a reduced capacity to manage the practical and logistical issues that got in the way of workshop attendance here. For example, less predictable work demands, fewer transport options to access the centre-based child minding provided, lower social support when the need to care sick children clashed with workshops, and poorer access to the centralised ‘catch up’ workshops\" (p. 264).

   "Abstract": "\"Few studies have explored the engagement of fathers in children’s schooling. Understanding the role that black fathers, in particular, play in their children’s education is both important and timely given the persistent opportunity gaps faced by many black students in the US and the influential role that black fathers can play in their children’s academic success. This paper thus explores the experiences and educational engagement strategies of a socioeconomically mixed sample of 16 black fathers in a predominantly white suburb in the US.

The indirect effect linking parental involvement to perceived academic competence via school self-esteem was signiﬁcant, β = .10, p < .05, 95% CI [.01, .19], providing evidence that school self-esteem mediates the association between parental involvement and perceived academic competence (see Table 2).

   "Assessment": "",
   "Results": "\"Children’s controlled and autonomous motivation was assessed with the Academic Self-Regulation Questionnaire (Ryan & Connell, 1989), which consists of statements describing four types of reasons for engaging in various academic activities. Across the activities, there are nine statements about extrinsic reasons (e.g., “I do my homework because I’ll get in trouble if I don’t”; s ranged from .80 to .88 in the United States and .67 to .77 in China), nine about introjected reasons (e.g., “I work on my classwork because I’ll be ashamed of myself if it doesn’t get done”; s ranged from .87 to .91 in the United States and .78 to .87 in China), seven about\nidentified reasons (e.g., “I work on my classwork because it’s important to me to do so”; s ranged from .86 to .91 in the United States and .84 to .90 in China), and seven about intrinsic reasons (e.g., “I do my homework because it’s fun”; s ranged .87 to .90 in the United States and .83 to .94 in China). Children indicated how true (1  not at all;5 very) each statement was of them.\" (p. 824). ",
   "Findings": "\n\"The substantial positive associations of parent-oriented motivation in school with extrinsic and introjected motivation in school suggest that parent-oriented motivation is largely experienced as controlled motivation by children. Children who are motivated in school to meet parents’ expectations hold externally regulated concerns (e.g., avoiding punishment and obtaining rewards from parents) in the academic arena. Regulatory concerns that are introjected—that is, taken in by children, but not fully accepted as their own—also appear to be central in that children who are motivated by parent-oriented reasons are driven by concerns to circumvent guilt and anxiety and cultivate pride and self-worth, likely through parents’ approval of their academic endeavors. Parent-oriented motivation was also positively associated with autonomous (i.e., identified and intrinsic) motivation, although to a substantially lesser extent than with controlled motivation\" (p. 828). \n\" Although children’s autonomous motivation took the form of viewing academic endeavors as personally valuable (i.e., identified motivation) more than finding such endeavors enjoyable (i.e., intrinsic motivation), it did sometimes take this latter form—perhaps because children’s parentoriented motivation causes children to develop skills that make school pleasurable\" (p. 829). \n",
   "Findings cont": "\"Of particular importance, the effect of children’s parent oriented motivation on their engagement in school was not accounted for by either their controlled or autonomous motivation, despite the latter having an effect on children’s engagement. The distinctiveness of children’s parent-oriented motivation is in line with the idea that such motivation serves a unique function in motivating children, given that the relationships children have with parents are often the most fundamental in their lives. Therefore, parent-oriented motivation may provide children with a particularly meaningful sense of purpose as they feel that they are working to fulfill the goals of central figures in their lives\" (p. 829). \n\" It is also noteworthy that the associations between children’s parent-oriented motivation in school and their controlled and autonomous motivation in school were practically identical in the two countries, indicating similarity in the nature of American and Chinese children’s parent-oriented motivation\" (p. 829).

The effect sizes for parental involvement were more than four tenths of a standard deviation for studies that had either most or all African American participants. Similar results were found for those studies that had either most or all Latinos and Asian Americans as their participants. Those studies that used most or all Asian American students as participants yielded smaller effectsizes. Nevertheless ,a meta-analysis examining these studies found that the effect size was still more than two tenths of a standard deviation\" (p. 213). \n\"When specific academic measures were examined separately, the same overall pattern emerged. All of the academic measures yielded statistically significant regression coefficients. What this indicates is that parental involvement appears to affect all levels of academic achievement:GPA, standardized tests, and other measures as well. Overall, one can conclude that parental involvement has a significant positive impact on children across race and across academic outcomes. This is an important finding for urban educators and parents. Second, the regression coefficients that emerged for GPA were typically smaller than those of the other academic variables. If one takes the average effect size for each academic variable and averages it across the racial groups included in this study, other measures yield the largest average effect size, and GPA produces the least. The fact that other measures were associated with the largest effect sizes would seem to be a reasonable and logical outcome. As mentioned in the Method section, other measures consisted largely of teacher ratings. Teachers are among the first to recognize and appreciate parental involvement. Therefore, one might expect that teacher ratings might be among the primary measures to reflect parental involvement.\" (p. 213). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Teacher ratings are more likely than other academic measures to reflect (a) a positive relationship between the parent and the teacher; (b) a senseofteamworkbetweentheparentandtheteacher,duetoincreasedcommunication between the two; and (c) an acknowledgment by the teacher of parental efforts. The combination of these factors probably explains a substantial part of the reason why other measures of achievement yielded larger effect sizes than the other measures\" (p. 214). \n\"It is more challenging to explain why parental involvement appeared to influence standardized test scores more than GPA. One possible explanation is that when parents get involved in their children’s education, they offer not only information specific to the classroom but likely help in giving children a broader level of academic information. To the extent that this is true, parental involvement may give minority children a larger advantage in standardized tests than in classroom tests\" (p. 214). \n\"Parental involvement apparently benefited African Americans and Latinos more than it did Asian Americans. African American children benefited from all kinds of parental involvement. Latinos and Asian Americans combined benefited from overall parental involvement more than Asian Americans alone, indicating that Latino students apparently benefit from parental involvement more than Asian American students do\" (p. 214). \"...results indicate is that when there is parental involvement from the parents of African American students, on the average, these children benefit more than their average Asian American counterparts. It may be that there are enough educational incentives present in other aspects of Asian American culture so that even without a large degree of parental involvement, students still do relatively well. It may well be that parental involvement has the greatest impact where there are not other cultural factors that are working to raise academic achievement\" (p. 215). According to research, African American and Latino children are more likely to come from a single- parent household. \"To the extent that the average child from a certain group is not likely to have a certain parent present or involved, the impact of parents’ actually being involved is likely to be that much greater\" (p. 215).

   "Abstract": "\"This article explores the difference between parental involvement, where parents' activity levels at school are primarily structured by schools, and parental engagement, where parents have a more active voice in how they take part in what goes on in schools. This difference is underscored as a means of illuminating ways of addressing the issue of racialized disproportionality in special education and acts of school discipline, particularly in urban settings. We highlight the ways schools need to transform the often microaggresively oppressive ways\nparents are invited into their children’s education process, as well as the way schools value the knowledge parents bring. Effective ways of activating parental engagement as a means of creating authentic community engagement are also examined. Additionally, recommendations are provided on how to prepare novice teachers to develop plans and goals alongside parents in order to help these new educators develop a pedagogical stance that authentically values the importance of one of schools’ most important stakeholders–parents.\"",

For a fruitful examination to take place, educators must also take the time to learn from families, learn about the communities from which they come, and capitalize on their knowledge of their children. Through this examination, exchange, and knowledge building (Kalyanpur & Harry, 2012), the social capital parents need to navigate schools successfully can be built. Educators can learn more about the students they teach and, therefore, help ward off the effects of implicit biases that often lead to minoritized students experiencing negative consequences for academic and behavioral challenges they might face. None of this can be done without full acknowledgement of the roles that race, culture, and class play in perpetuating the inequities in the modern school system —inequities that place an inordinate amount of minoritized children in special education and subject them to acts of discipline in an unjust manner.\" (p. 223).

On close examination, the strength of conventional PI doubles as one of its primary limitations: It is school-centered and individually oriented. That is, conventional PI implicates a one-way relationship between families and schools in which parents are expected to volunteer in service of the school. Notwithstanding the types of opportunities provided to individual parents through school-centered PI activity (such as the PTA), research suggests that this approach may not be best suited for the initial involvement of some economically poor parents, particularly those who perceive that they lack the necessary invitations, backgrounds, or social-cultural resources to participate or to advocate for their children's education.\" In contrast to school-centered, individualistic models, community-centered, collective approaches to PI have gained increased currency over the past 15 years in economically poor, culturally diverse school communities\" (p. 173). \"A second important pathway involves identifying, describing, and validating the technical mechanisms and organizational capacities needed to bridge the divide between schools and parents. More concretely, empirical studies are needed that highlight how social workers and other agents of the school might organize and mobihze groups of parents (collective PI) and also how new bridges developed between schools and groups of active parents might produce improved outcomes for children, families, and schools\" (p. 173).

Specifically, the program was structured to encourage and support parents as they identified the results they wanted and needed and then worked to achieve them. In addition to improvement in parents' own senses of self-worth and motivation, parents also report that respect and recognition from other adults, including other parents, was important to their ongoing PI. For these parents, perceptions of respect and recognition appeared to lead to feelings of connection and belonging among members of the PI program. Social workers directed and coordinated the PI program in this study. Parents identified these social workers as important initial facilitators for PI. Parents identified five social work practices as instrumental for their involvement: door-to-door outreach, persistence, passion, responsiveness, and information and resource linkages\" (p. 177). ",

The direct effect of Familismo on parental involvement showed that students who endorse the cultural value of cohesive and interdependent family relationships are likely to perceive parents as involved in their education. The supported direct effect of welcoming school climate on parental involvement indicates that students who perceive a welcoming school climate also perceive more involvement of their parents in education. This finding shows students’ awareness and sensitivity to the attitude of school staff toward their parents\" (p. 561). \n\"Contrary to expectations, the direct effect of life-context barriers on parental involvement was not supported.  Life-context barriers might be surmountable when parents are motivated to participate in their children’s education\" (p. 562). \"Also, the hypothesis positing the direct effect of parental involvement on academic socialization was supported.

These life-context barriers did not have a significant effect on parental involvement but had a significant, negative effect on students’ academic achievement. This is an interesting finding in that students’ perception of barriers to parental involvement has more to do with students than parents. Perhaps students’ perception of barriers to parental involvement influences their engagement in school. Because students spend most of their time in school, they might be more familiar with their schools’ expectations of parents. Even though parents are involved in promoting academic success at home, students might feel the gap based on the school’s perspective\" (p. 562). \nFamilismo was significantly negatively related to academic achievement. \"Because Familismo is a complex, multidimensional construct, different aspects of Familismo might have different effects. For instance, the Familismo value that emphasizes interconnectedness and cohesiveness among family members can play a key role in facilitating parental involvement. However, the emphasis on obligations and making sacrifices for other family members might not align well with the value for individual achievement. The complexity of the interacting nature of the Familismo cultural value in different contextual situations needs more investigation\" (p. 562). \"The result of the pathway from Familismo to parental involvement, academic socialization, and academic achievement is consistent with the previous study that found parental involvement to be a mediator between Familismo and academic performance (Niemeyer et al., 2009).

   "Abstract": "\"Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Kindergarten Cohort (N¼13,970), we examined whether two aspects of school-family connections, parental involvement and communication quality, accounted for the association between classroom composition and children’s academic and socioemotional functioning following the transition to elementary school. For students with more same-race=ethnic representation in their classrooms, greater classroom race=ethnic diversity promoted more parental involvement, which in turn promoted children’s interpersonal skills and reading achievement. Classroom diversity made little difference to parental involvement when students had fewer same-race=ethnic peers in the classroom. Teacher–parent communication quality did not emerge as an explanatory mechanism, and ﬁndings did not vary by the race=ethnic match between students and their teachers\"",

(1996) identify segregation (particularly high concentrations of African American and Latino individuals) as strongly linked to inhibiting educational environments that, in turn, foster adaptive cultures that may differ from mainstream culture. In inhibiting contexts, the interactions and proximal processes that occur therein hinder optimal growth and development (e.g., poorer teacher expectations for students, greater use of practices that make ability differences between students more salient; Farkas, 2003). The integrative model would suggest that diversity, in contrast, would support more promotive educational settings and greater uptake of the larger norms around involvement and engagement in school\" (p. 128).

   "Assessment": "",
   "Results": "\" parental involvement was signiﬁcantly associated with samerace/ethnic representation (b= -.05, p<.01) and the diversity-by-representation interaction (b= -.03, p<.05). This interaction, although small, is of similar magnitude to some of our race=ethnic covariate effects on parent involvement (e.g., Latino, African American, and Asian American vs White brange¼.07 to .13, p<.001). Parental involvement at school mediated the relationship between the diversity-by-representation interaction and both students’ interpersonal skills (bind= -.002, p<.05) and reading achievement (bind=.001, p<.05).

   "Abstract": "\"This study explored parents’ responses to a family component developed as an addition to the Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS). The family component was developed to improve engagement and participation in CBITS and to support parents’ own skill-building. To evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the family component from the perspective of parents who participated, qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 low-income, Latino parents (80% female; 80% immigrants; average age  38.07). Themes emerged across 3 primary categories: Need for CBITS  Family, Results of Participating in CBITS  Family, and Implications for Feasibility. Parents agreed that there was a need for programs like CBITS and expressed a firm belief in the importance of parental involvement with their children and schools.

CBITS includes 10 group sessions for children that incorporate education about reactions to trauma, relaxation training, cognitive therapy, stress or trauma exposure, and social problemsolving, which have been shown to reduce symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. CBITS was originally developed in response to high rates of community violence, though it has been extended to treat other types of trauma.\" (p. 325). ",
   "Assessment": "",
   "Results": "",
   "Findings": "Parents voiced their need to particpate in the CBITS+ Family for a number of reasons, citing  \"issues children face, importance of parent involvement, and motivation to participate\" (p. 328).\nIssues Children Face:  Concerns about neighborhood safety (being exposed to violence from a number of sources, exposure to substance use). \nImportance of parent involvement: State that children are aware of their parent's involvement in school and it can give them a sense of security. Being involved allows parents to be aware of issues occuring instead of being out of the look or assuming something is/ is not happening. \nMotivation to participate: \"Parents offered four common motivations for participating in CBITS and the family component sessions: supporting their child and providing their child with an opportunity to learn skills (12/15), addressing their children’s symptoms (9/15), responding to a child’s stressful or negative experience (8/15), and obtaining help for themselves (5/15)\" (p. 329). Parents also noted participating as a way of helping to alleviate some of their own anxieties, such as dealing with stress related to familial issues. ",
   "Findings cont": "Sometimes, parentes cited inflexible schedules as reasons for not participating iin as many sessions. Some posited a make- up session may be helpful if they were unable to attend a meeting. Some suggested advertisement of the program may invite and make other parents feel welcome to attend. \n\"Though there remain concerns about disseminating evidenced-based treatments (EBTs) to low-income ethnic minority populations because of uncertainty that they will be acceptable or relevant, the results of this study suggest core skills such as problem-solving, relaxation, cognitive restructuring, praise, and consistency are both acceptable and beneficial. This has important implications when considering current views on whether interventions should be culturally adapted. Though there is not consensus, what seems to be important is striking a balance between fidelity to the original evidence-based components and the incorporation of culturally informed care (e.g., use of cultural concepts, addressing issues of migration, family values, language. One approach to delivering such balanced interventions for ethnic minority families has been to partner with the community to ensure successful implementation\" (p. 332). \nSee table 2 for more in- depth explanations of parent perceptions.

   "Findings": "Steps for implementing the Growth Mindset Model for use with children with varying learning disabilities:\n1. \"Gather Baseline Data\" (p. 47). Use scales to measure what childrenthink about intelligence. \"One popular mindset measure is the Project for Education Research That Scales (PERTS) Growth Mindset Scale (Blackwell et al., 2007\" (p. 47). To help children with learning disabilities: \"(a) provide a model/think-aloud demonstration of how the Likert-type format works, completing a few items for the class on an overhead projector or Smartboard; (b) preteach some of the terminology that may be new or confusing for students (e.g., substantial); (c) read the quiz items aloud to the class to facilitate student understanding and answer any questions about vocabulary that may arise; and (d) explain that there are no wrong answers or judgments attached to the quiz\" (p. 47). \n1. \"Define Growth Mindset and Fixed Mindset\" (p. 47). Visually representing the concepts of growth and fixed mindsets may be helpful for children with learning disabilities. Perhaps have students sort explanations of each into the category (growth or fixed) in which they belong.\n3. \"Examples and Explanations of Growth Mindset\" (p. 48). Use video explanations, refer to people who have overcome learning difficulties, use a K-W-L Chart (p. 48): What do they know, what do they want to know, and what have they learned? Use open discussion to get students to compare ideas and learn from other students. \n4. \"Create a culture that fosters growth mindset\" (p. 48). Teach students their opinions are validated and they have much to contribute. Ask students why they think having a growth mindset will be valuable in the classroom. This can be a hands- on activity/ an ongoing practice integrated into the classroom. \n5. \"Model Growth Mindset\" (p. 49). Utilize own experiences to teach when you can positively react to an obstacle/ mistake you made. Show students even though it may be frustrating, it is nothing to be ashamed of. Explain your thought process when attempting to solve problems. \n6. \"Allow room to grow\" (p. 49). Help students understand it's ok if they falter at times and have reverted to operating from a fixed mindset. Teachers may turn their own experiences about using a fixed mindset and what the result was. Describing ways children can relay their own feelings can be helpful.\n",
   "Findings cont": "7. \"Fill the classroom with examples\" (p. 49). Visual aids and other interactive displays may remind students to consider their choices throughout the day. Encouraging positive self- talk could be another strategy. \n8. \"Consider grading and feedback: A grade of Not Yet conveys the message that learning is a process that takes time\" (p. 50). Praise positive behaviors and achievements. \n9. \"Generalizing beyond the classroom\" (p. 50). Help students think of times when they can apply the growth mindset in other settings besides the classroom. \n\"One potentially effective and efficient means of reducing the academic achievement gap is to 'help students cope with threats to their identity that impair intellectual functioning and motivation'\" (p. 50). ",

   "Notes": "Noting when students are doing well and helping them identify their own strengths is so important. This can be applied not only in classrooms with children with learning disabilities, but for with all children. Giving students the foundtion to moinitor their own thoughts and behavior at an early age is helpful. The \"Not Yet\" grade seems like wonderful way to push students to acheive their academic goals."

   "Findings": "\"The three main themes evident in the data – namely ﬂexible and mixed-ability grouping, enhancing classroom climate and goal-setting – were directly linked to the intervention strategies taught and further subthemes could be found for these themes\" (p. 297). \n\"Flexible grouping refers to the practice within classrooms of ensuring students encounter a range of grouping conﬁgurations. When students work in ﬂexible groups it might be that they are matched with other students in relation to readiness, interests or social groupings. Students are instructed in ability groups but have different grouping arrangements for their learning activities\" (p. 291). \nLetting children choose activities they were interested in rather than structuring activity time so rigidly seemed to show positive outcomes. It helped to give children a greater sense of autonomy. Also, grouping less skilled readers with more skilled readers together allowed children to collaboarate: those less skilled found needed support while those more skilled liked being in the helper role. \nChanging classroom climate: \"Innovative or improved practices presented at the project meetings included creating time to ﬁt in activities about positivity, including more positive approaches into their teaching, administering sociograms and class inventory surveys to gauge the implicit social structure of the classroom, and making children more responsible for the classroom climate\" (p. 300). Though most teachers reported enjoying implementing new strategies to change the classroom climate,some found it difficult to change previous patterns of behavior. ",
   "Findings cont": "Goal setting: \"As an assessment tool, e-asTTle is used in New Zealand to assess students’ achievement and progress in reading, mathematics and writing. e-asTTle is particularly effective in fostering goal-setting because, through individual student reports, it lists the learning objectives that students have already achieved taking their achievement level into account and provides the next student learning objectives. This helps teachers and students to monitor each student’s learning progress and plan the way forward. Participants believed this gave students greater ownership of their learning and was particularly motivating, especially when students were able to self-select areas from their e-asTTle results to set goals\" (p. 301). \" teachers expanded on what they had found useful, which included students being able to stay focused on their next learning steps, co-constructing success criteria, setting targets and self-assessing and peer assessing of goals. Some participants reported that goal-setting was enabling children to self-manage their learning and identify their own levels and gaps within these\" (p. 301). \n\"Timperley (2008) commented that as teachers discover new professional knowledge and practice what they have learned, they begin to feel more effective as teachers and this outcome has a positive effect on student learning\" (p. 303).

   "Findings": "\"Children’s self-efficacy does respond positively when they learn to set short-term, realistic goals and are shown how to make progress toward these goals. It is not a matter of convincing them they can do well or even guaranteeing it; it is giving them the strategies to do so\" (p. 412). \nYounger children do not differentiate between effort and ability. Older children understand effort does not equal ability and wish to be thought of in terms of ability. \"Ability is important in most class- rooms; when students’ self-concept of ability is threatened, they display failure-avoidance motivation. They engage in failure-avoiding tactics such as not trying, procrastinating, false effort, and even the denial of effort\" (p. 413). \"Over time, children who believe that failure is caused by a lack of ability are likely to exhibit a sense of helplessness. Low expectations, negative affect, and ineffective strategies characterize these children. Children with this dysfunctional attribution pattern are less likely to develop or enact those metacognitive skills that will enable them to tackle a wide range of classroom tasks.\" (p. 413). \n\"Students who are interested in learning new things and developing their skills and ability have been described as mastery-oriented. These students are willing to expend the necessary effort to learn something new and con- front challenging tasks. Students who instead perceive that normative performance is important and want to demonstrate that they have ability or to protect their ability when threatened are labeled performance-oriented. Such students tend to think more about their ability than about “how to do the task.”\" (p. 414). \n\"In contrast to what we might surmise, providing or en- suring successful outcomes or feedback does not necessarily bolster children’s confidence in their abilities. Such a prescription ignores the role of cognitive motivational factors in determining how children interpret their classroom experiences. For many children success is not sufficient to create or maintain a belief that they have the ability to reverse failure. Children who are con- vinced that they lack the necessary ability to do school tasks do not take re- sponsibility for success and even underestimate their performance when they do well. Thus, it is not a matter of persuading them they can do well or even guaranteeing it; instead, practice should involve giving them short-term goals and strategies for making progress toward the goals.” Once students understand how to reach a goal and focus on strategies, rather than out- comes, they are more likely to “own” the outcome. \" (p. 415). \n",
   "Findings cont": "\"The praise children receive is often on irrelevant aspects of a task; in these in- stances, children discount the praise. Praise on easy tasks or praise that is noncontingent on children’s effort or performance quality can be interpreted by children as evidence that they lack ability; it can, therefore, have un- intended negative effects on children’s self-confidence. The effects of praise must also be considered from a developmental per- spective. Praise can be interpreted quite differently by younger and older children. Praising young children’s effort conveys to them a positive expecta- tion that they can do the work and can enhance their perceptions of their competence. Because older children have differentiated concepts of ability and effort, praising their effort may actually be interpreted by them as low expectations for their ability. \" (p. 416). \nTeachers are taught that reinforcing behavior with rewards is key, but often this strategy is overused. It also is applied to whole groups where individual differences are not recognized. \nGive children choices to help increase their involvement: The issue with this is children sometimes will pick what is easiest or what they know will preserve their sense of ability. \nTelling a student to work harder may be demeaning to one believing they are trying their best. Also, implying putting in extreme effort is the best strategy may lead children to be very motivated sometimes but disheartened over time. \n\"When we look at the classroom, there are six areas of organization that are manipulable and that involve motivational concerns: task, authority, rec- ognition, grouping, evaluation, and time. Preservice teachers often learn a great deal about only one area, and practicing teachers often focus on one or two areas but do little in the others. As a consequence, motivation becomes restricted to one area of the classroom. Often that area is reward or recognition (providing rewards and incentives), and even in that area in- appropriate strategies are used. \" (p. 419). ",

   "Abstract": "\"Since the original Pygmalion study, there have been very few interventions in the teacher expectation field and none that have been randomized control trials designed to change teacher practices to reflect those of high expectation teachers. The current study was designed to address this gap in the literature. Teachers (N = 84) were randomly assigned to either intervention or control groups. Those in the intervention group attended four workshops at which were presented the instructional strategies and practices of high expectation teachers. At each workshop, the intervention group planned changed practices to introduce to their classrooms modelled on the behaviours of high expectation teachers. The researchers visited the teachers on three further occasions to ensure fidelity of the implementation. Students in the classes of the intervention group teachers significantly improved their mathematics achievement over one year, showing a rate of improvement beyond that shown by the students of the control group teachers. Teachers reported high levels of satisfaction with their changed practices and overall, there was a demonstrable degree of integrity in the implementation of the intervention as measured by the researchers.

This represents an improvement above the control group of approximately 28%. In simpler statistical terms, the improvement in mathematics scores for the intervention group amounted to an effect size of d = 0.49.

All means were above the mid-point of 3.0 on the 1–5 Likert scale and some were above 4.0.

Speciﬁcally, students from School A reported more frequent pursuit of social goals and stronger interest in class, and nominated classmates as being prosocial more often than did students in School B; School B teachers rated their students’ as being more irresponsible than did teachers in School A. Classroom effects were signiﬁcant for each teaching dimension and all student outcomes; effect sizes were quite large for each variable (see Cohen, 1992). These signiﬁcant classroom effects indicated that student perceptions of teachers were fairly consistent within classrooms\" (p. 293). \n\"Teaching dimensions also were related signiﬁcantly to student adjustment outcomes. Speciﬁcally, prosocial behavior was related signiﬁcantly to teaching dimensions of fairness, negative feedback, and high expectations; irresponsible behavior was related signiﬁcantly to all of the teaching dimensions except teacher motivation; and academic achievement was related signiﬁcantly to the dimensions of fairness, negative feedback, and high expectations. Of interest for the question of mediation were signiﬁcant relations between teaching dimensions and adjustment outcomes, and between motivation variables and adjustment outcomes. Prosocial goal pursuit was related positively to prosocial behavior and responsibility goal pursuit was related negatively to irresponsible behavior. Interest in schoolwork was related signiﬁcantly and positively to academic performance, whereas mastery goal orientations were not related signiﬁcantly to performance\" (p. 295). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"With respect to the ﬁrst question, students’ reports yielded clear distinctions among teachers along the ﬁve teaching dimensions: signiﬁcant classroom differences were found with respect to expectations, fairness, rule setting, negative feedback, and teacher interest in subject matter. Therefore, as with parents and their children, teachers can be characterized in terms of the socialization contexts they establish for their students. In addition, the ﬁve teaching dimensions accounted for signiﬁcant amounts of variance in motivational, behavioral, and academic performance\" (p. 295). \" perceptions of teachers as a function of students’ race and gender did not moderate relations between teaching dimensions and student outcomes\" (p. 297). \n\"The overall signiﬁcance of teaching dimensions in relation to student adjustment provides initial evidence that models of parent socialization are generalizable to nonfamilial contexts. Conclusions concerning causality, however, are premature. For instance, it could be argued that the present ﬁndings reﬂect that good teachers simply reinforce the work already accomplished at home, or that students who have adopted the same goals and interests as teachers in turn motivate teachers to treat them in ways that characterize nurturant and effective parents. When compared with perceived support from parents and peers, however, perceived support from teachers has been found to be unique in predicting young adolescents’ interest in class and pursuit of goals to be socially responsible (Wentzel, 1998). Students’ perceptions of general levels of support from teachers also predict changes in prosocial goal pursuit and academic effort across the middle school years. Finally, when elementary school teachers are trained to provide students with warmth and support, clear expectations for behavior, and developmentally appropriate autonomy, their students develop a stronger sense of community, increase displays of socially competent behavior, and show academic gains \" (p. 297). \n\"a second objective of the present study was to examine whether students’ motivation mediated relations between teaching dimensions and more objective aspects of school adjustment. Evidence for mediation was not found, although speciﬁc teaching dimensions such as high expectations and negative feedback were related to social behavioral outcomes by way of their relation to social goal pursuit (see Table 3). Therefore, student motivation does appear to play a role in linking teaching styles to students’ social behavior.\" (p. 298). \n\"dimensions of teaching that correspond to dimensions of effective parenting appear to have a complex relation to young adolescents’ adjustment to school. High expectations for students was the most consistent positive predictor of students’ goals and interest, and negative feedback was the most consistent negative predictor of academic performance and social behavior. Moreover, in contrast to research on parenting, teaching styles appear to explain school-related outcomes for African American as well as European American students. The apparent utility of parent socialization models for explaining teacher inﬂuences on students’ adjustment to school also supports a conclusion that school-based interventions to promote social competence and academic excellence might proﬁt from insights gained from work with families and parent intervention programs\" (p. 300).

",
   "Findings": "Having greater levels of expectations impeded academic success for children more among parents with highger \"negative self feelings\" than those with lower \"negative self feelings\" (p. 364). \n\"Children’s feelings of high parental expectations may be counterproductive if the parents, hampered by their own neg- ative feelings about themselves, are not able to provide the educational environment and resources important to their chil- dren’s academic success. When personal problems prevent parents from following through on the high goals they set for their children, they may experience so much stress that they are unable to provide the children with “the time and attention they recognize as necessary” (Snow et al., 1991, p. 88). Also, parents’ negative self-feelings may affect the nature of the par- ent-child interaction over homework, which also may affect the child’s academic performance. To the extent that such par- ent-child interactions are more a source of pressure than encouragement, children may resist, rather than accept, the high expectations of their parent\" (p. 367). \n\"The new findings indicate that that relationship is relatively stronger for parents who, as young adults, reported higher negative self-feelings than it is for parents who reported lower negative self-feelings. One like- ly explanation involves the possibility that parents with higher levels of negative self-feelings will, because they are strongly motivated to improve their self-feelings, more firmly embrace the areas in which they have been success- ful and avoid the areas in which they have been unsuccessful. In turn, they may project their embrace of strong areas and avoidance of weak areas onto their children. In other words, while trying to work out their own psychic difficul- ties, parents may provide ambiguous and inhibiting expec- tations for their children that may reduce their adolescent’s autonomy\" (p. 366). ",
   "Findings cont": "\" parents with higher levels of education and higher negative self-feelings may, to some extent, be liv- \ning out their own self-expectations through their children. Those parents may pressure their children “to perform pre- cisely as they demand” (Klein, Altman, Dreizen, Friedman, & Powers, 1981, p. 16); the unstated goal would be “the reduction of their own anxiety.” On the other hand, parents with low levels of educational attainment and high levels of negative self-feelings may emphasize other areas besides academics in which they are likely to excel. Those parents may feel it is unnecessary to be concerned about poor academic performance, and they may communicate lower academic expectations to their children, on the basis of the idea that “I couldn’t do it, and you should- n’t be expected to do it either” (Klein et al., 1981a, p. 16). Those parents may be conveying the message simultaneous- ly that, “I made out okay [without being academically suc- cessful]; you will too.” In both cases, parents experiencing negative self-feelings who are at the two ends of the educa- tional attainment spectrum are trying to enhance their self- worth by projecting their own academichonacademic self- images onto their children.\" (p. 366). \nChildren that must make their own judgements about parental expectations may: a) feel the sense that their parents perceive them as not capable enough or b) refer to their prent's level of education as an example of what they are expected to attain. \n\"An even more parsimonious explanation might be that children in homes with parents with relatively low levels of educational attainment would likely live in circumstances that would not consciously foster or expect high levels of education without explicit and direct communication of high expectations by the parents. On the other hand, children in homes with parents with high levels of educational attain- ment would likely be exposed to many resources that would support and foster their educational achievement.\" (p. 367). \n\"On the other hand, high parental negative self-feelings, net of the interaction with educational expectations, seem to result in relatively higher student academic performance. That finding may reflect the type of family dynamic in which parents have negative self-feelings about their own circumstances, but they want to ensure a better life for their children.\" (p. 368).

   "Abstract": "\"Much research has examined the effects teacher expectations have on student performance. While evidence indicating that expectations bias student performance is scant, a substantial literature suggests expectations can sustain performance at undesirable levels. Classroom observation reveals consistent patterns of differential teacher behavior toward high- and low-expectation students. No model has yet emerged, however, which integrates particular treatment findings into an influence sequence. Such a model is presented, outlining the cognitive processes through which teacher expectations can sustain a given level of achievement. The model suggests that teachers frequently give affectively valanced feedback to low-expectation students as a mechanism for interaction control. High-expectation students more frequently receive feedback based on their effort expenditure. These different evaluation contingencies may lead lows to believe less strongly than highs that effort will influence academic outcomes. Differences in effort-outcome covariation perceptions may lead to less persistence and more failure on the part of lows than highs, thus sustaining poorer performance.

",
   "Findings": "\"The current study conﬁrmed and extended the ﬁndings of previous studies that have found that intrinsic motivation is positively associated with engagement.

",
   "Findings cont": "\"researchers and school psychologists may beneﬁt from greater consideration of intrinsic motivation to learn as an intervention target to promote academic engagement and achievement, while promoting mental health.

Our research with both middle-income European–American mothers and immigrant families in the USA supports the idea that goals of relatedness may be viewed as promoting goals of autonomy. One area in which this functional dependence was especially evident concerned connection to the family vis-à-vis personal acheivement and success. Parents noted that promotion of family values enables children to work hard and ultimately become successful\" (p. 193). \n\"It is also possible for parents to view autonomy as interfering with relatedness, as illustrated in Miller and colleagues’ (2002) research on Taiwanese and US parents’ views about self-esteem. In contrast to the individualistic emphasis on the importance of self-esteem, Miller notes that the term ‘self-esteem’ does not exist in the Chinese language. When probing Taiwanese mothers about this construct, she relied on the closest translation—‘self-respect in heart and mind’. She found that although US mothers spoke at length about the importance of self-esteem when asked about their child-rearing views, Taiwanese mothers rarely spoke of self-esteem, and when they did, they spoke of it as an undesired quality that would interfere with their children’s social adjustment.\" (p. 191). \nIndividualist and collectivist ideas may be apparent in a person's life within different contexts. \nSome immigrant parents may feel the strain of balancing values of relatedness and autonomy once seeing children's behaviors as conflicting with their own ideas surrounding the socialization process.

Design/methodology/approach – An ethnographic methodology was used to explore in-depth the mechanisms by which food practices included indicators of school connectedness, andusedinterviews and observations with teachers and 16-18-year-old students in a New Zealand secondary school. Findings – The results describe six key mechanisms by which shared lunches fostered school connectedness: showing common humanity, creating aninformal setting, encouraging sharing, enabling inclusive participation, demonstrating sacrifice for the communal good, and facilitating experiences of diversity. These mechanisms contributed to increased social interactions in which people got to know each other better and were able to gain insight into others’ personalities. This allowed for opportunities to establish and strengthen social relationships, and contributed to indicators of connectedness. Research limitations/implications – The study is exploratory with findings reported from one school. Further research in other contexts on the value of shared lunches for building school connectedness is required.

   "Results": "N/A",
   "Findings": "\"Eating together revealed something inherently human everyone had in common, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or age. This commonality at food events appeared to create an atmosphere of equality, in which people were able to connect on one level. Shared lunches also revealed common humanity because the associated rules and practices were familiar to participants. The simple act of eating something, for instance, seemed to operate tacitly as a common denominator in which human qualities were easily exposed Many teachers said food allowed them to 'break down the professional façade and let out the personal one' (T02). Some teachers felt that students often failed tosee them as human beings because of their authority position, whereas food events were a vehicle for them to be “humanised” in their students’ eyes. This was understood as an important aspect of successful relationships with students\" (p. 559). \n\"At shared lunches the normal classroom structure was broken up, when students were not at their desks, but sitting in a circle. Consequently new interactions arose between members of the class. Equally teachers were not physically separated from students, which made them more approachable. The practice of sitting in a circle with food in the middle was important for creating a greater sense of belonging, it was perceived to create a “community environment rather than departmentalised, where you feel the whole class is one\" (p. 559- 560). \n\"The social setting further encouraged conversations across the whole class to emerge on topics beyond curriculum content, ranging from issues within the school to current news debates. Teachers sometimes initiated such conversations, at other times the conversations emerged through food comments, but also random comments sparked collective conversations. Overall, it appeared that the time for conversations, facilitated through the informal, social setting, made more students feel comfortable participating in discussions, which facilitated a stronger sense of class community\" (p. 560). \n\"Sharing food seemed to encourage other types of sharing. For instance, many teachers found that students were quite inquisitive during shared lunches, asking them personal questions and being equally willing to share stories about themselves\" (p. 560). \n\"The extension of such conversations into whole class discussions seemed to exhibit a sense of commitment to one’s class through knowing others and feeling more confident to participate in lessons. One teacher also reported that since she had been doing regular shared lunches the students had been more cooperative and sharing with their work, with the overall impression that food sharing had increased reciprocity between the girls. An important consideration is that the bond created through shared food practices was not intimate, but the overall culture of the class was affected and brought about a greater sense of community through acceptance and knowing others.\" (p. 561). ",
   "Findings cont": "Some of the students commented about feeling a sense of awkwardness, though, during the meal times. \n\"Food events were a way of celebrating different cultures in which students were ableto gain insight into other customs. The nature of a shared meal, the food consumed, and how it was consumed, was subject to cultural variation, making shared lunches an ideal hub for learning about, and possibly increasing tolerance for these differences\" (p. 562). \n\" Fear of eating in front of others could be mitigated through offering a broad range of foods at the event. For instance, availability of healthy foods such as fruit, allowed even those with calorie aversions to participate while not facing the conundrum of being coerced to eat high calorie foods, or not participating at all\" (p. 565).

   "Abstract": "\"The impact of parental involvement on student academic achievement has been recognized by teachers, administrators, and policy-makers who consider parental involvement to be one of the integral parts of new educational reforms and initiatives. This study synthesized the results of nine meta-analyses that examined this impact and it identiﬁed generalizable ﬁndings across these studies. The results indicated that the relationship between parental involvement and academic achievement was positive, regardless of a deﬁnition of parental involvement or measure of achievement. Furthermore, the ﬁndings revealed that this relationship was strongest if parental involvement was deﬁned as parental expectations for academic achievement of their children.

   "Findings": "\" The most prominent parental involvement components in the analyzed meta-analyses were communication between parents and children regarding school, checking and helping with homework, parental educational expectations and aspirations for their children, and attendance and participation in school activities. As for the measures of academic achievement, they can generally be divided in two broad categories: standardized tests and non-standardized assessments. The most common non-standardized measures included in the meta-analyses were grade point average, class grade, test grade, and teachers’ ratings regarding both students’ academic performance and their behavior\" (p. 390). \n\" As children are likely to harbor similar attitudes and beliefs as their parents, having high parental expectations appears vital for academic achievement of children\" (p. 392). \n\" The synthesized ﬁndings implied that there was no positive relationship between homework assistance and student academic achievement. In some instances, homework assistance was even negatively correlated with student achievement. One of the plausible explanations of these results is that most parents are not trained to teach certain concepts, regardless of their difﬁculty, or they may not be familiar with appropriate teaching methods. It is also likely that students who are struggling academically represent the majority of children requesting parental assistance in homework, which could help explain negative trends between homework involvement and academic achievement. This leads to another possible explanation regarding negative correlations between the two constructs\" (p. 392).\n",
   "Findings cont": "\"all the studies that examined the effect of ethnicity on the relationship between parental involvement and student academic achievement were consistent in their ﬁndings that this relationship is generalizable across race. This is an important ﬁnding, because it conﬁrms that parental involvement may signiﬁcantly contribute to reducing the achievement gap between different ethnic groups\" (p. 393). \n\"the relationship between parental involvement and student academic achievement was found to be consistent across various measures of achievement. The manner of assessing student scholastic performance did not seem to impact the existence of the relationship between parental involvement and academic achievement. It did, however, affect the strength of that relationship. More speciﬁcally, the impact of parental involvement on student performance may be signiﬁcantly stronger if there is a more global measure of the achievement, for example, grade point average, rather than a speciﬁc measure, such as a grade on an in-class achievement test\" (p. 393). \n\"A lack of consistency in ﬁndings was also evident when parental involvement was deﬁned by home supervision, which for the most part consisted of establishing and enforcing the rules regarding school and home activities, and providing opportunities and environment conducive to learning.

The program involved training a small, representative group of students in a school to identify prejudice and discrimination in everyday life and to intervene when they witness prejudiced behavior or speech among their classmates.\" (p. 180-181). \nAn intervention focusing on news stories about interracial relationships led to \"students in the intervention school developed more tolerant attitudes regarding interracial marriage and afﬁliation and less overall hostile and violent orientations\" (p. 181). \n\"An intervention that created opportunities for intergroup dialogs among students and taught conﬂict negotiation skills increased participants’ social awareness, positive attitudes toward other groups, and likelihood of taking action to address discrimination. Small groups of diverse (in terms of race, gender, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, and religion) students participated in intergroup dialogs, which were led by skilled facilitators.

Students with demonstrated behavior problems were assigned to the program, which required them to meet brieﬂy with a counselor or social worker at the beginning of every school day to review expectations, carry a positive behavior checklist throughout the day to be scored by each classroom teacher, and meet brieﬂy again with a counselor or social worker at the end of the school day to review their checklist and expectations.\" (p. 181).\nStrong Evidence:\nMindfulness intervention: Implemented in the classroom once per week for 40- 50 minutes in the classroom and three times per day for three minutes.  \n\"Students who participated in career academies through the Junior Reserve Ofﬁcer Training Corps were found to have higher retention rates. The academies were schools within schools with a common team of teachers that drew on an integrated academic and vocational (e.g., health care, business and ﬁnance, information technology) curriculum and partnered with local businesses in developing and delivering the curriculum.\" (p. 182).

   "Findings cont": "Dimension: School Safety\nVery Strong Evidence:\nA violence- prevention curriculum incorporating \"role play, experiential learning, and didactic instruction\" 25 times in 50- minute sessions (p. 183). \n \"A social-development curriculum designed for African American male students was found to reduce rates of school-based violence (Flay, Graumlich, Segawa, Burns & Holliday, 2004). The curriculum comprised 16–21 lessons on building self-esteem and empathy, managing stress and anxiety, developing interpersonal relationships, resisting peer pressure, and developing decisionmaking, problem-solving, conﬂict-resolution, and goalsetting skills. The same program, but with an additional parent and community component, demonstrated a mitigating effect on rates of school-based violence, student provoking behavior, and school delinquency. The parent and community component involved the creation of tasks forces of school staff, students, parents, and community members that met regularly to discuss the implementation of the curriculum, potential school policy changes to promote student health, and school-community partnerships that may support student health.\"\nStrong Evidence:\nAnother violence- prevention program: \" A committee of school administrators, counselors, district staff, and researchers from a nearby university developed and oversaw the 2-year implementation of the program. At the school-wide level, the program involved a violence-prevention curriculum that was taught as an elective class in the ﬁrst year of implementation and included lessons on conﬂict resolution and interpersonal skills. A character education curriculum was infused into academic classes in the second year of implementation and included lessons on citizenship. Another school-wide intervention involved a school safety assessment to address safety concerns in the school physical environment and visitor protocol. Students with demonstrated behavioral problems participated in six small group meetings and/or completed a computer-based module that focused on conﬂict resolution, anger management, character education, and drug and alcohol education\" (p. 183). \nAnother violence- prevention program:  \" The curriculum was taught by trained teacher and included seventeen 45-min lessons on developing a nonviolent identity, anger management, and conﬂict resolution. The lessons used didactic instruction, discussions, and experiential learning as strategies and included writing exercises based on stories about conﬂict resolution. Violence-prevention materials were posted in hallways and a manual was provided to teachers, counselors, and school psychologists to assist them in reinforcing curricular themes with students outside of class. Another violenceprevention curriculum was found to reduce school-based incidents of violence\" (p. 183- 184). \nDimension: Disciplinary Environment\nVery Strong Evidence:\n\" The school-based mentoring program described in the “Relationships” section was also found to reduce participants’ number of ofﬁce discipline referrals\" (p. 184). \n\"The violence-prevention curriculum noted in the “Safety” section was also found to reduce in-school suspensions \" (p. 184). \nIntervention for males struggling with aggression included parents in the intervention. Student and parent attended separate meetings. Sessions focused on \"anger management, social problem- solving, and organizational and study skills.\" Program lasted 15 months and was held at school (p. 185). \nStrong Evidence:\n\"Service- learning program that involved a small number of community service hours and weekly meetings where students could reflect upon the experience helped minimize suspensions.\n\"A violence-prevention curriculum taught in the context of a school-wide effort to teach and reinforce positive behavior among all students demonstrated a mitigating effect on ofﬁce discipline referrals (Sprague et al., 2001). The curriculum was taught by trained teachers and included lessons on anger management, problem solving, and empathy. The lessons used role-play and didactic instruction. The school-wide component included staff training to support non-violent behavior, publicity to remind students and staff of expectations for non-violent behavior, an incentive system to reinforce desired behavior.\" (p.  186). \n\"The violence-prevention curriculum noted in the “Safety” section was also found to reduce ofﬁce discipline referrals and suspensions among students\" (p. 186). \nDimension: Physical Environment\nModerate Evidence:\n\"Speciﬁc characteristics of the physical environment associated with student achievement included the presence of clear and comfortable indoor and outdoor walkways, public spaces that foster a sense of community, outdoor spaces, natural light in classrooms, and views of the outdoors from classroom (i.e., not simply walls, parking lots, or roads). Attendance rates were also higher when a school had fewer temporary buildings and more custodians. Similar physical characteristics, including general cleanliness and cleanliness of bathrooms, comfortable temperature, and the absence of vandalism and broken windows, doors, or desks were all associated with greater perceived safety among students . Furthermore, staff perceived less crime and witnessed less misconduct in schools with displays of school pride (e.g., awards, trophies, murals) in hallways and where school grounds are visible from the surrounding community (i.e., “natural surveillance\" (p. 186).

Using nationally representative data (N = 1,609) from the National Education Longitudinal Survey, this study focuses specifically on Mexican American families and youths, a population at high risk for academic underperformance. Findings show that the positive effects of parental involvement among Mexican American parents occur through involvement in the home, whereas parental involvement in school organizations is not associated with youths’ achievement. Parents’ investment of financial resources in their children’s education was found to have a somewhat higher impact on achievement than forms of involvement that require parents’ investment of time.

Family income was also associated with higher test scores (β = .137). Parents helping with homework and whether the child was male were both negatively related to test scores (βs = −.165 and −.130, respectively). It is important to stress that parents helping with homework was only negatively associated with achievement once all other forms of parental involvement in academics were considered; the bivariate association between these variables was not significant, although it was \nnegative. Finally, parent participation in school organizations and immigrant generation were not related to test scores. Parental involvement in school organizations had small to moderate bivariate relationships with other parental involvement variables and small correlations with eighth- and 10th-grade test scores (see Table 1). However, when other forms of parental involvement were taken into consideration, parent participation in school organizations was not a significant predictor of academic achievemen\" (p. 165).\n\"The single strongest predictor of 10thgrade scores in this model was prior achievement in the form of eighth-grade scores. Although all five parenting variables found to be significant predictors of test scores in the first model were significantly related to eighth-grade scores in model 2, none of them had a significant, direct impact on 10th-grade scores above and beyond their indirect relationships through eighth-grade test scores.\" (p. 166).

   "Findings": "Most significant findings indicate promising impacts of parental involvement occurred due to home involvement. \n\"However, study findings suggest that investment of financial resources toward children’s intellectual development through extracurricular instruction and educational resources in the home had a somewhat greater impact on achievement than did forms of involvement that represent an investment of parents’ time\" (p. 166). \n\"a recent study found that among four forms of parental involvement in education—homework monitoring; homework help; communication; and academic expectations, as assessed through youths’ perceptions—only academic expectations were significantly related with Mexican American students’ GPAs and educational aspirations\" (p. 167). \n\"The fact that parent involvement in school organizations was not found to be significantly related with academic achievement in this study suggests that other forms of involvement assessed here have a stronger association with achievement and, arguably, provide better targets for policy and program interventions\" (p. 167). \n\"Similarly, the finding that parents helping youths with homework, one form of parents’ home-based involvement, was associated with lower achievement scores should be interpreted in light of other included parent involvement factors, meaning that help with homework was negatively associated with achievement, but only when all other forms of involvement were taken into account, suggesting that parents who help with homework are also likely to engage in other forms of parental involvement that are positively associated with achievement\" (p. 167). Perhaps parents increase their involvement with homework when they recognize the child is having difficulty in school. ",
   "Findings cont": "\"The more surprising finding was that parents’ discussion of school-related matters, including discussion of plans for high school and beyond, did not have a significant impact on youths’ achievement between their last year of middle school and their second year of high school. one would expect this form of involvement to be particularly salient during the transition to high school and to influence youths’ achievement. This finding, on the contrary, suggests that discussing school matters may function as a form of socialization, much like engaging in enriching activities with children, such that the specific content of discussion may not be as important as discussing education in general, and the positive impact of such activities on achievement may occur earlier\" (p. 167- 168).

When children and adolescents perceive a parental focus on high grades and demonstrating competence (or avoiding the demonstration of lack of competence), however, they are more likely to adopt approach or avoidant performance orientations and, in turn, maladaptive patterns of learning, including dysfunctional coping in instances of failure or the lack of coping\" (p. 121).

All factor loadings were significant, and the average factor loadings were .51, .57, .84 and .89 across the grades.\" (p. 124). \n\"Direct relationships from perceived parent goals to students' help-seeking attitudes were not found for any of the four age groups, except for the marginally significant direct relationship between perceived parent performance goals and HS− for 4th grade students (β = .20, p = .05). However, there was support for indirect effects, specifically in grades 4, 6, and 9. At grade 4, perceived parent performance goals positively predicted HS+ via student mastery goal orientation (β = .16, p < .01) and negatively predicted HS− (β = −.11, p < .01) by the same indirect path. At grade 6, parent performance goals positively predicted HS+ (β = .09, p < .05) and marginally negatively predicted HS− (β = −.06, p = .05) via mastery orientation. No significant relationships were found for grade 7. At grade 9, HS+ was predicted positively by perceived parent mastery goals (β = .30, p < .001) via student mastery orientation and negatively by parent performance goals (β = −.17, p < .01) via the same goal orientation. At the same grade, HS− was also predicted by both parent goals via student mastery goal orientation (β = −.22, p < .001 and β = .13, p < .01, respectively for parent mastery and parent performance goals).\" (p. 125). ",
   "Findings": "\"Contrary to Hypothesis 1, we generally found no evidence that perceived parent goals directly predict students' adaptive help-seeking attitudes. Instead, in line with Hypothesis 2, perceived parent achievement goals influence help-seeking attitudes indirectly through their relations with students' own achievement goal orientations, and these structural relations vary with age. In particular, when 4th and 6th graders perceived that their parents emphasized the importance of performance and ability they were more likely to adopt a personal mastery orientation and, in turn, were higher in HS+ and lower in HS−. At grade 7 none of the perceived parent goals directly or indirectly predicted help seeking attitudes. For older students the role of perceived parent performance goals not only reversed but, in addition, the influence of perceived mastery goals also became influential. Ninth grade adolescents who perceived that their parents emphasized mastery goals were more likely to espouse mastery goal orientations and, in turn, were higher in HS+ and lower in HS−, with the reverse pattern for perceived parent performance achievement goals. Thus the perceived parental emphasis on ability and interpersonal comparisons appears to have different consequences for children and adolescents; specifically, it has positive outcomes for elementary children, no outcomes in early adolescence and negative outcomes in middle adolescence. It should also be noted that perceived parent mastery and parent performance emphasis were highly correlated at grades 4 and 6, moderately correlated at grade 7 and not significantly related at grade 9. That is, performance- and mastery-related messages that elementary school children perceive from their parents are not fully differentiated at this age. This significant association fades along with age, and perceived parent mastery and performance messages become fully differentiated by middle adolescence\" (p. 126).\n\"At 10–12 years of age, children do not clearly distinguish the concepts of ability and effort, although signs of such developmental attainment are present in the form of the intermittent use of ability as a compensatory cause for lack of effort in the case of a particular outcome (Nicholls, 1979). Evidence in the present study is consistent with the notion that elementary school children tend to interpret their parents' emphasis on performance goals as the way to achieve mastery, whereas those perceptions become more congruent with their own goal orientations, apparently as ability and effort become joint determinants of outcomes by the age of 13 and beyond\" (p. 126- 127).  ",
   "Findings cont": "\"That students in the present study moved to junior high school at grade 7 (around the age of 12–13) with its greater emphasis on performance evaluation must also be taken into consideration, as well as the importance of student autonomy and the role of peers relative to parents. The absence of an association between perceived parent goals and students' own goal orientations in 7th grade does not necessarily denote that parental goals as perceived by early adolescents are no longer important but rather a consequence of developmental and contextual changes during the transition phase for early adolescents. By middle adolescence (grade 9) parent goals as perceived by the students regain significance in predicting students' own goal orientations. Specifically, positive outcomes are associated with a perceived parental emphasis on mastery at this age, such that personal orientation towards mastery is more likely to be adopted by the students and in turn help seeking is encouraged and help-avoidance discouraged. Perceived parental emphasis on performance is not associated with positive outcomes, as it is during the elementary school years, but rather to negative outcomes such as discouragement of personal mastery orientations and maladaptive help seeking attitudes.\" (p. 127). \n\"Results in the present study highlight the importance of taking students' developmental phase into account when examining help-seeking and its avoidance, especially in regard to student achievement goal orientations or perceptions of goals emphasized in significant contexts such as the school and the family\" (p. 127). \n\"students who are focused on understanding and acquiring knowledge and skills are more likely to acknowledge the benefits of seeking help and to intend to do so, as well as are less likely to prioritize its potential costs and to avoid seeking help. Second, students who are highly concerned with not performing well and afraid of negative judgments by others, are more likely to think of the potential costs of help seeking and to intend to avoid seeking help. In other words, mastery-oriented students, who probably need help less since they employ adaptive learning patterns (Karabenick & Knapp, 1991), are more likely to exhibit positive attitude towards help seeking and do it for adaptive reasons. By contrast, students who are in greater need of help such as performance-avoidant students who usually employ maladaptive learning patterns are unlikely to adopt a positive attitude towards help seeking and to seek it because of their ability-related concerns and the fear of unmasking incompetence. \" (p. 127- 128).

This qualitative study uses a Grounded Theory approach to examining parent’s perceptions of their ability or inability to be involved in their children’s education by querying about factors impacting involvement and their experiences overcoming barriers. A semi-structured interview guide was used to collect data on parents (N = 12) of youth who participate in a public housing after-school program by way of focus groups. Results suggest that parents are hopeful about engaging in education, but often fail to become actively involved because they feel marginalized.

Marginalization is manifested cyclically for these parents. Implications for strategies helping parents become more involved in the educational process are identiﬁed.\"",

   "Results": "\"The coding processes resulted in ﬁndings that revealed one overarching category, called factors impacting parental engagement. This category contained ﬁve unique themes: tangible barriers, supports and resources, marginalization, jumping through hoops, and school choice. Each theme, the deﬁnition, examples, and quotes from participants are reported in Table 1.\n\" (p. 422). ",
   "Findings": "\"Tangible barriers- These barriers were considered by parents to be practical challenges that often stood in the way of involvement. Not having enough time, lacking ﬁnances, transportation, or access to technology were all concrete obstacles facing the majority of these parents\" (p. 425). \nSome parents cited \"communities, agencies, family members, or other loved ones for support\" (p. 426). Many parents praised the Bridge Program for providing their children with help they may not have been able to give themselves. \n\"Marginalization was a meaningful theme that emerged where parents often felt ostracized and powerless to make a change in their child’s education. The impact of marginalization was so strong as it truly paralyzed those parents who sought to be involved\" (p. 126). \"Parents often directly felt as if the school’s response was to dismiss them. Parents reported feeling that they were excluded from school activities, information, or not considered an asset as a result of their status. The parents were aware of the stigma related to living in a public housing community. Parents were also ﬁlled with fear when they would challenge authority. Feelings of fear would emerge when parents would try to question or resist the current mode of operation in the school systems.\" (p. 427). \n\"Jumping through hoops: Jumping through hoops is deﬁned as any attempt to solve problems and overcome the power differentials through the process of talking with several people or taking multiple steps, however, often not leading to any conclusion. The parents described several times when their complaints and frustrations went unsolved, despite going through the process of jumping through hoops. It was often a process of fruitless efforts to make changes, assert themselves, or challenge the system. Unlike the resources and supports, which mitigated the tangible barriers, jumping through hoops or trying to ‘‘work the system’’ instead proved to cause more frustration, more hopelessness and acted to reinforce the parents’ powerlessness and marginalization.\nNow I understand why parents don’t say stuff, it’s like a process of like ﬁve or six days on the phone, meeting, calling, calling, meeting, to get anything done—It makes you want to just give up\" (p. 427). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Participants who had an active choice about the school felt more welcome, reported the teacher to be more accessible, and believed their children were receiving a better education: ‘‘there was a vibe between me and the teacher, I can call her any time, e-mail her, call her, go in the classroom’’. Tangible barriers prevented parents from being able to access school of choice, thus often reinforcing the stigma of living in a low-income community. Although participants reported being able to overcome many barriers through their resources and networks, tangible barriers played a signiﬁcant role when it came to school choice. In fact, tangible barriers were the primary reason many offered as to why they were not able to make use of the school choice option the school district provides.\" (p. 428). \n\"What was evident with the parents from this sample was that they were extraordinarily creative in their ability to solve problems that could be solved. For example, parents were able to gain access to computers through community agencies if they didn’t have one at home, arrange childcare or transportation as needed for school events, or ﬁnd ways to help their children with homework. Because these parents valued education, solving logistical problems, although difﬁcult at times, was important to them. So, it is unlikely that lack of resources is exclusively attributed to lack of involvement\" (p. 428). \n\"Instead, it appears as though the greatest barrier to parents’ ability to engage in their child’s education is marginalization. The parents’ low-income statuses caused them to feel fear, guilt, and shame, and consequently, they were less involved. Feeling alienated from society prompted them, in turn, to alienate themselves from their children’s educational institutions. The stigma associated with being lowincome made parents fear ‘‘making waves’’. Power differentials were clearly evident between the parents and society, with the parents feeling powerless due to their hierarchical placement. The parents attempted to address power differentials and feelings of helplessness through ‘‘jumping through hoops.’’ They would be required to combat numerous hurdles when asserting prowess in the school systems. The responses from the school system were often unconstructive and served to intensify feelings of shame. Therefore, jumping through hoops only reinforced feelings of powerlessness and marginalization. \" (p. 429). ",
   "Study Limitations": "The cross- sectional design did not allow for opinions over time to be captured. Also, time for participation in events was cited as a barrier, and thus more parents with valuable insight may not have been able to attend the focus group. ",
   "Notes": "\"rather than trying to provide direct, tangible beneﬁts, an innovative intervention approach aimed at deconstructing and resisting the power paradigm that propagates marginalization could be considered. This study suggests that giving parents some say or choice in the process is something that makes them feel more powerful, and can lessen the effects of marginalization\" (p. 430). "

   "Abstract": "\"Purpose: The authors’focus was on understanding antecedents of parent trust toward schools. Two questions guided the inquiry: Is there a systematic difference in parent-school trust across schools?If so,what organizational conditions predict between-school variability in parent-school trust? Research Methods / Approach: Using multilevel modeling, this study examined school-level determinants of individual parent-school trust from a sample of 79 schools and 578 parents drawn randomly from a Midwestern state. Findings: Intraclass coefficients were first examined on the school-level attitudinal variables to determine their collective disposition. Estimates indicated that these conditions were collective properties of schools. Results from the Level 1 Means-As-Outcomes analysis showed that 16% of the variance in parent trust was explained by school membership. Level 2 predictors were entered individually with significant variables retained and entered into a combined model. Affective norms of parent perceived influence on school decisions (β5j =5.0, p<.01) and school identification (β4j = 2.7, p < .01) had larger individual effects on parent-school trust than contextual conditions. Conclusion: Findings support the conceptualization of school trust as a collective property of school role groups that forms through affective, cognitive, and behavioral norms. Parent trust is not inherently deficient in schools plagued by social and contextual challenges. Regardless of poverty status, school size, diverse ethnic composition, and school level, school leaders can build and sustain parent trust by aligning policies and practices to address the affective needs of parents. Doing so reduces parents’perceived vulnerabilities and risks within the parent-school relationship\"",

   "Description": "\"A model developed by Adams (2008) based on the empirical evidence on trust formation accounts for the interrole group relationships that are characteristic of school organizations. He argues that trust mechanisms operate in the social environment to influence trust discernments of role groups much like Bandura’s (1986) sources of efficacy-producing information. The sources of trust formation that Adams identified in the literature were classified as behaviors, beliefs, and feelings. Contextual characteristics such as school size, economic status of students, school level, and prior academic performance were accounted for in Adams’ model but only as having an indirect effect on trust through its direct effect on the social environment\" (p. 12). ",
   "Assessment": "",
   "Results": "\" Results indicate that school level (β1j = –5.1, p < .01), prior academic performance (β1j = 3.9, p < .01), school socioeconomic status (β1j= 2.3, p < .05), school identification (β1j = 5.2, p < .01), and parent influence on school decisions (β1j = 7.2, p < .01), all individually accounted for a significant proportion of the between school variability in parent trust when separately entered into the model. Percent white was the only nonsignificant variable. Next, the significant predictors were entered simultaneously into the combined model to test our second hypothesis. Socioeconomic status and prior academic performance were not statistically significant in the combined model. School-level (β1j = –2.0, p < .05),school identification(β4j=2.7,p<.01),and parent-perceived influence on school decisions (β5j = 5.0, p < .01) were three conditions that individually accounted for a significant proportion of the parent-school trust variance across schools, confirming our second hypothesis\" (p. 25- 26). \n",
   "Findings": "\"As our findings show, parent trust also varies by factors that affect the opportunities for parents to make discernments about the trustworthiness of the school. Similar to teacher trust, school membership explained variability in parent trust perceptions, suggesting that differences in organizational features lead to variation in parent-school trust. Our Level 1 analysis did not report the specific organizational effect on parent perceptions, but it did confirm the hypothesis that parent trust does systematically differ across schools, depending on the social and contextual environment of the school\" (p. 26- 27). \n\"Within our sample, variation in parent trust across schools was predominantly explained by organizational norms that affect the dyadic relationships between parents and teachers. Parents’ sense of influence on school decisions and students’ feelings of belonging and value accounted for the most between school variability in parent-school trust. An increase of one standard deviation in these variables amounted to a 5.1 point and 2.7 point increase in parent-school trust, respectively. The effects of contextual conditions—SES, prior academic achievement, ethnicity, and school level—were not as strong as the normative conditions in the combined model. Given the disproportionate effect these contextual variables often have on school outcomes, this was an important finding. Boundary spanning interactions that fostered interrole group cooperation among parents and school authorities and a school culture aligned with the affective needs of students were more critical antecedent conditions of parent trust.\" (p. 27). ",
   "Findings cont": "\" It is empowering for educational leaders who frequently contend with uncontrollable contextual circumstances to know that boundary-spanning interactions are more important for the formation of parent-school trust than innate, uncontrollable conditions. Parent trust is less dependent on contextual classifications of schools, such as high poverty, at-risk,or high performing, and more dependent on the social norms that address the emotional and affective needs of parents. Processes that used collaboration to bring parents from the periphery of schools into the operating core functioned as a powerful genesis of parent-school trust. Allowing parents to share in the educational responsibility by redesigning the operational frameworks to be more inclusive can be an effective first step to building and sustaining parent trust\" (p. 28). \n\"First, structural configurations that support boundary-spanning interactions between teachers and parents build a foundation to sustain a culture of parent-school trust. Without opportunities for frequent interactions with teachers, students, and administrators, parents cannot develop the emotional and cognitive connections through which trust beliefs form (Lewis & Weigert, 1985). Our findings substantiate this idea. Social interactions are the means by which parents gain appropriate influence in schools. Interactions that represent our vision of boundary-spanning collaboration are ones that generate awareness and understanding of educational issues, not ones that provide parents formal authority to make managerial or instructional decisions.This latter type of involvement can have deleterious consequences for trust because it may dismiss the technical expertise of teachers and circumvent the authority structure of schools. Second, parent-school trust is situated within the social network of a school. Contextual conditions, such as socioeconomic status, school size, diversity, and so forth, influence parent trust to the degree that they shape social exchanges within the relational network. The intentions of school authorities are perceived to be more trustworthy when the collective behavior of teachers and administrators affirms the value of parents and students. Interrole group trust is a social phenomenon that embodies role group behavior, emotional states, and cognitive beliefs. Third, building parent trust depends on bridging the relational gap between parents and schools that heighten perceived vulnerabilities and risks. The salience of vulnerability and risk is greatest when knowledge of another role group’s behavior is scarce. Conditions that facilitate parent collaboration and student identification with school communicate the healthy intentions of school authorities.\"",

   "Abstract": "\"The present study challenges the assumption that cultural capital beneﬁts students' academic achievement regardless of their educational stages. Meta-analytic results from 105 studies published 2000–2017 indicated that nine cultural capital variables (e.g.,home educational resources, maternal and paternal education, parental expectations, cultural participation, home support, school participation) beneﬁted all students while ﬁve cultural capital variables exhibited a differentiated pattern of relationship with student achievement depending on educational stages. First, compared to students from higher grade levels, kindergarteners beneﬁted most from parental education, parental academic emphasis, and parent-child reading. Second, compared to 1st–6th graders, 7th-12th graders beneﬁted more from academic discussions. Third, compared to 1st–6th graders, both kindergarteners and 7th-12th graders beneﬁted from parental school involvement. These results provide compelling evidence that while there are some forms of cultural capital that all students will beneﬁt from, there are others whose association with students’ achievement depends on their educational stages.\"",

Embodied cultural capital comprises academic values, attitudes, tastes, and preferences; and mastery of academic competencies and skills emphasized in schools. Parents may equip their children with embodied cultural capital through their worldviews (academic emphasis and expectations), cultural participation, parent-child academic discussions, parent-child reading, and home (support for and supervision of children) and school involvement (parent-teacher communication and participation in school activities). Institutionalized cultural capital is formed when embodied cultural capital is publicly recognized as a marker of social distinction (e.g., parental educational attainment).\" (p. 2). ",

   "Results": "\"there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in eﬀect sizes across students’ educational stages for eight speciﬁc cultural capital variables at the 0.05 level, namely home educational resources, maternal education, paternal education, parental expectations, cultural participation, home support, school participation, and home/school involvement composite\" (p. 6). \n\"However, there was a diﬀerentiated pattern of relationships between ﬁve cultural capital variables and academic achievement contingent on students’ educational stages (Table 3). First, the mean parental education eﬀect size was larger for kindergarteners (reference group) than students from higher grade levels (G1-6, β=−0.24; G7-12, β=−0.10; p < .01). Second, the mean academic emphasis eﬀect size was larger for kindergarteners (reference group) than students from higher grade levels (G1-6,β=−0.36; G7-12, β=−0.32; p < .01). Third, the mean academic discussions eﬀect size was larger for G7-12 (β=0.11, p=.03) than G1–6 students (reference group); there were no samples with kindergarteners only. Fourth, the mean parent-child reading eﬀect size was larger for kindergarteners (reference group) than G1–6 students (β=−0.15, p < .01); there were no samples for G7–12 students only. Lastly, the mean school involvement eﬀect size was larger for kindergarteners (reference group) and G7-12 students (β=−0.07, p=.61) than G1-6 students (β=−0.23, p=.02)\" (p. 6- 7). ",
   "Findings": "\"The analysis showed that 14 speciﬁc cultural capital variables were signiﬁcantly associated with student achievement. The relationship between cultural capital and student achievement may be explained by the concept of habitus, which is enduring and transposable and required for school success (Bourdieu, 1979). For example, teachers may perceive students who have higher levels of home support as being more competent and, therefore, give them more attention and learning opportunities\" (p. 7).  \n\"There were ﬁve cultural capital variables whose relationship with student achievement depended on students' educational stages. First, results showing that parental emphasis was more strongly associated with kindergarteners' academic achievement may reﬂect the alignment between parental focus and teacher expectations. For example, Bassok et al. (2016) found that a greater percentage of kindergarten teachers perceived the need for their students to be ready for school by demonstrating self-regulation (65–91%) and social skills (72–87%) than to master counting skills (35%). Young kindergarteners are also more impressionable and malleable, so parental emphasis on learning may have a greater impact on their achievement. In contrast to kindergarteners, secondary and high school students are more developmentally mature in their thinking (Adams & Berzonsky, 2003; Lerner & Steinberg, 2004), so interventionist parental strategies may be less eﬀective than academic socialization strategies such as bi-directional parent-child academic discussions (Hill & Tyson, 2009). This may explain the results showing that academic discussions were more strongly related to the academic achievement of students from higher grade levels (G7-12). Second, the stronger relationship between parentchild reading and student achievement for kindergarteners may reﬂect diﬀerent reading habits – younger children reading with parents while older children engaging in independent reading. Third, the strength of relationship between school involvement and student achievement is baﬄing. On the one hand, greater school involvement at kindergartens beneﬁts young children's transition to formal schooling. Furthermore, secondary and high schools are more bureaucratic and complex in terms of the number of teachers and curricular choices (Hill & Chao, 2009), so parents may not know which teachers to contact to discuss their children's learning. Therefore, parental school involvement may enable them to engage their children's teachers and contribute to their children's achievement. On the other hand, results also showed that the relationship between school involvement and student achievement was lower for G1-6 students. Future research is needed to unravel this nuanced pattern of relationships.\" (p. 7- 8). \n",

",
   "Results": "",
   "Findings": "\"Different views of children, teachers, and schools create communication barriers between immigrant parents and home-born teachers, which go beyond the language as the means of information exchange. Although further research is required, the few available studies show that in the English-speaking countries the impetus is on parents to initiate the involvement, but “good parents” are expected to do it in a way that supports existing policies and practices rather than criticizes the school system. Parental involvement is encouraged, but only in forms approved by the school and beneficial to it. If you are overtly critical of school practices, you are labelled as “too involved” , but if you are not a frequent visitor in classrooms, then teachers may consider you “hard to reach”. Coming from different cultures and being shaped by different educational experiences, immigrant parents are often caught between the two extremes of inadequate and excessive involvement\" (p. 368). \n\"Many immigrant parents face challenges to parental involvement similar to those of homeborn ethno-cultural minorities (racial and cultural discrimination; low teacher expectations) and working-class parents (lack of formal education, poverty). Additionally, the vast majority of immigrant parents also deal with two specific obstacles: language barriers and insufficient familiarity with the educational system of a host country. From the perspective of teachers, second language learners are often constructed as deficient, so parents with low proficiency in the dominant language are also seen as less competent\" (p. 369). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"The invisibility of immigrant parental involvement is also affected by the ways immigrant parents communicate with schools. Dyson (2001) found that while Euro-Canadian parents communicate more with their children’s instructors, prefer face-to-face interaction and discuss topics of a social nature, Chinese-Canadian immigrant parents communicated with teachers less, relied more on written messages and expected to discuss academic performance of their children in detail. As a result, immigrant parents in the sample were not happy with school-home communication, while parents born in Canada showed higher levels of satisfaction. Immigrant parents communicate for their children’s academic purposes instead of supporting schools’ agendas\" (p. 368). \n\"Moreover, Doucet (2011) found that parents from dominant backgrounds in the USA perform parental involvement as a ritualized practice which marginalizes diverse parents who do not share the insider knowledge taken for granted in local contexts. Parents who do not belong to the group, most often represented by white middle-class mothers with flexible work schedules, are excluded from the “core” parental community visible in schools (Doucet 2011). Immigrant parents are normally located outside of this group and are not privy to the knowledge and information circulated through such networks\" (p. 370). ",
   "Study Limitations": "This study does not give specific demographics, so it may be helpful to examine those to see if there are any salient differences found among parents. Also, this study does not detail the type of work the immigrant parents do once in a new country, which may or may not facilitate the assimilation process. \nIt is not known either what levels of trainings the teachers in these studies had regarding cultural competency.",

In detail, the results show a slightly higher correlation of student burnout and social support among secondary school students than for postsecondary school students, but the correlations between each dimension of student burnout and social support were almost the same at a glance. This finding explains that the aspects or processes of burnout in the relationship with social support could be similar among both groups of students, regardless of school type.

These are important types of involvement, but an emphasis on these types of actions results in a lack of appreciation for other types of involvement and the devaluing of many groups (Aceves, 2014; Alfaro et al., 2014).

   "Description": "\"Hoover\nDempsey and Sandler model of the parental involvement process proposes three major sources of motivation for involvement (Figure 1). The first is parents’ motivational beliefs relevant to involvement, including parental role construction and parental selfefficacy for helping the child succeed in school. The second is parents’ perceptions of invitations to involvement, including general invitations from the school (e.g., positive school climate) and specific invitations from teachers and children. The third source is personal life context variables that influence parents’ perceptions of the forms and timing of involvement that seem feasible, including parents’ skills and knowledge for involvement, and time and energy for involvement.\" (p. 532).

   "Assessment": "\" All measures (at both time points) underwent face and content validity evaluations by a panel of five persons who had expert knowledge of the constructs being evaluated. \" (p. 536). ",
   "Results": "See tables 2 and 3. ",
   "Findings": "\"Supporting the value of examining intrapersonal (e.g., parents’ personal beliefs) and interpersonal (e.g., perceptions of others’ invitations) factors in concert, both forms of involvement were predicted by parents’ perceptions of invitations to involvement from others, motivational beliefs, and perceived life context, respectively. Specifically, parents’ home-based involvement was predicted by perceptions of specific child invitations, self-efficacy beliefs, and self-perceived time and energy for involvement. These same constructs, along with perceptions of specific teacher invitations, predicted parents’ school-based involvement. It is interesting to note that self-efficacy beliefs are a strong positive predictor of home-based involvement but a small negative predictor of school-based involvement; this may be because parents who are strongly motivated to be involved but do not feel efficacious in their involvement efforts are likely to reach out to the school for assistance\" (p. 540). \n\" For elementary school parents, home-based involvement was predicted by perceptions of invitations from children, motivational beliefs (i.e., self-efficacy and role activity beliefs), and perceived time and energy for involvement, respectively. This same order of constructs predicted the home-based involvement of middle school parents with the exception of role activity beliefs. This was counter to our expectation that role beliefs would contribute to maintaining home-based involvement during middle school, a period when children typically press for greater independence and schoolwork becomes increasingly difficult. However, these findings may also indicate that parents’ role beliefs about home-based involvement change as children assert greater independence. This possibility is supported by the fact that the majority of variance in middleschool parents’ home-based involvement was accounted for by perceptions of child invitations.\" (p. 540- 541). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Two constructs, parents’ self-perceived skills and knowledge and perceptions of general school invitations, were significantly correlated with outcome variables but did not predict involvement. Multicollinearity may have played a suppressing role; for example, intercorrelations between parental self-efficacy and self-perceived knowledge and skills may have obscured the specific contributions of each. The failure of general school invitations to predict involvement may be related to the correlation with specific teacher invitations, suggesting that general school invitations may generally influence parental involvement only through specific teacher invitations. The failure of general school invitations to predict involvement may also be due to limited variability in school climate across varied schools in the district, although we view this as unlikely given the apparent uniqueness of school climate across many of the participating schools\" (p. 541).

   "Abstract": "\"Perfectionism consists of personal predispositions and attitudes toward performance. Although there is some disagreement in the ﬁeld regarding how to best deﬁne and measure perfectionism, most studies have supported a distinction between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism.

The sample consisted of 256 high school students who completed questionnaires assessing adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism, perceptions of their parents and personal achievement goals. Structural equation modelling supported the hypotheses suggesting that high parental standards are positively associated with the adaptive perfectionist characteristic of self-organised perception, which in turn are associated with a mastery goal orientation.

",
   "Description": "Multidimensional Approach to Perfectionism ",
   "Assessment": "The Pattern of Adaptive Learning Scale (PALS) has been \"previously used and validated in Hebrew. Exploratory factor analysis (using principle component analysis with Varimax rotation) supported the construct validity of the items\" (p. 770). ",
   "Results": "\"The correlation matrix of the variables (Table 1) provides additional support for the construct validity. For example, parents’ expectations were highly associated with personal standards and moderately associated with organisation and concern over mistakes, but not associated with doubt over actions. Parents’ criticism was highly associated with concern over mistakes and doubt over actions, whereas it was negatively associated with organisation and not with personal standards. In addition, adaptive aspects of perfectionism, such as organisation, were highly associated with mastery goals and performance-approach goals, but not associated with performance-avoidance goals. Maladaptive aspects of perfectionism including concern over mistakes and doubt over actions were not associated with mastery goals, but highly associated with performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals. Mastery goals were not associated with the other goal orientations. Performance approach and avoidance were positively associated with each other\" (p. 771). \n\" It was expected that perception of parents’ high expectations and criticism would be associated with the patterns of perfectionism and that these, in turn, would be associated with goal orientations. The model presented in Figure 1 was found to have acceptable ﬁt indexes (χ² = 43.3, df = 16, p < .001; CFI = .95, NFI = .92, RMSEA = .08). \" (p. 773). ",
   "Findings": "\" perception of parents as having high expectations was strongly associated with having high personal standards and being self-organised, but there was also a weaker association with concern of making mistakes. The pattern of the results supports the hypothesis that, in general, parents’ expectations may promote adaptive aspects of perfectionism\" (p. 773).\n\"Notably, the perception of parents as critical was negatively associated with both aspects of adaptive perfectionism (i.e. personal standards and self-organised), while it was positively associated with the maladaptive aspect of perfectionism (i.e. concern with making mistakes). As for achievement goals, the self-organised aspect of perfectionism was associated with mastery goals, the personal standards aspect was associated with performance-approach goals, and concern with making mistakes was associated with both performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals. In general, the adaptive aspects of perfectionism had stronger associations with the adaptive goal orientation, while the maladaptive aspect of perfectionism was associated with less adaptive goals\" (p. 773). \n\"The study supports the notion that perceptions of parents’ behaviours (as being critical and as setting high standards) should be separated from the perfectionism itself. These parental characteristics were also assumed to be associated with perfectionism in such a way that parents’ high standards would predict adaptive perfectionism, while parents’ criticism would predict maladaptive perfectionism\" (p. 774). \n",
   "Findings cont": "\"the speciﬁc hypothesis was that adaptive patterns of perfectionism would be associated with the adaptive achievement goals (i.e. mastery) and that maladaptive patterns of perfectionism would be associated with less adaptive achievement goals (i.e. performance-avoidance). The ﬁndings supported the hypothesised model and, thus, are particularly signiﬁcant for educational research and practice because they concern students in a regular school context. These ﬁndings indicate that encouraging students toward high-standard performance may even facilitate adaptive goal orientations, but only if this encouragement does not increase concerns about making mistakes. In other words, students should not be afraid of the consequences – even if these are just emotional responses – of performing less than perfectly.\" (p. 774). \n\"Our study demonstrates that the performance-approach goal was predicted by both adaptive and maladaptive aspects of perfectionism. Students with higher personal standards and those with greater concern about making mistakes reported higher levels of performance-approach goals. Educators should note that even adaptive aspects of perfectionism may lead to less desirable motivational orientations and, therefore, should construct learning environments that emphasise a mastery goal orientation. Other studies have suggested that encouraging peer collaborations, avoiding competition, evaluating students’ effort (rather than performance) and supporting student autonomy in learning should lead to mastery goal orientation\" (p. 775). \n\"In sum, adopting a multidimensional approach to the study of perfectionism reveals that being self-organised is an adaptive aspect of perfectionism that is associated with adopting mastery goals. It also reveals a maladaptive aspect of perfectionism, concern over mistakes, which is associated with the adoption of performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals. It is important to note that the study focused on a general population and was not aimed to diagnose acute psychological conditions (Dickie et al., 2012). In general, the results of the study indicate that parents and educators would be advised to set high expectations while decreasing the level of criticism for most students. However, this advice might not apply to adolescents with acute psychological conditions who might respond differently to antecedents of perfectionism such as the setting of expectations and ways of criticism; rather, they should be properly diagnosed and provided with suitable treatment regarding their perfectionism\" (p. 775). ",
   "Study Limitations": "Cross- sectional study, so changes across time could not be examined. ",
   "Notes": "Understanding the implications of each type of goal orientation can help teachers know which strategies are best for motivating students. By guiding children to focus more on enjoyment of learning rather than the need to be evaluated positively can help children achieve success."

   "Assessment": "Examination of the Hoover- Dempsey Model",
   "Results": "\"To be most effective, parental engagement needs to be rooted in the home, in an attitude that fosters learning in the home, as this has been shown to be most positively related to children’s achievement. In a series of telephone surveys, researchers found that parents are aware of the importance of engaging with their children’s learning, yet have decreasing conﬁdence in undertaking this role. Using interviews with staff, evidence was found that schools still see parental engagement as primarily focused on the school, with parents supporting the school. As schools and parents move along the continuum, there is a move from information giving (on the part of schools) to a sharing of information between parents and schools. This is a move from the prioritisation of the school’s needs and desires to joint decisions between parents and schools. As can be seen, the continuum does not represent a transfer of all agency from schools to parents but rather a more equitable distribution of agency with regard to children’s learning, between parents and schools, to a change in the relationship among all three actors in the process\" (p. 402). ",
   "Findings": "1st point: \"This point on the continuum is characterised by the agency of the school; school staff predominate in the relationship with parents. The school is in control of the relationships and the ﬂow of information; information is given to parents but not sought from them. Parents may be involved in activities, but those activities are instigated and controlled by the school. For the most part, these activities will take place in and around the school\" (p. 402). \n2nd point: \"The next level on the continuum can take place either in school or in the home, and is characterised by an interchange of information between parents and school staff. The focus of this interaction is schooling – the processes which surround learning. Hughes and Greenhough describe this process as one which “aims to recognise and exchange ‘funds of knowledge’ between teachers, parents and children …” (2006, 471). They also suggest that “home-school knowledge exchange activities cannot be seen as the simple transmission of depersonalised knowledge from one party to another. Instead, they need to be seen as complex communicative activities in which the participants actively represent their practices and interests, and interpret these representations in terms of their particular purposes and agendas” (Hughes and Greenhough 2006, 471). The value of this interchange is extolled by Graham-Clay (2005) who suggest that these interchanges of knowledge will serve to build up trust and better relationships. At this point on the continuum, agency in relation to supporting children’s learning is shared between parents and the school. This point also represents the furthest along the continuum that schools can direct; at this point, schools can still initiate and guide discussions and interventions, in conjunction with (not just “with the help of”) parents.\" (p. 404). ",
   "Findings cont": "3rd Point: \"This point is characterised by the greatest exercise of parental agency. Parents actions may be informed by the school, or based on information provided by the school, but the choice of action and involvement remains with the parent. This point is mainly shown by what Desforges and Abouchaar call “at home modelling of relationships and aspirations” (2003, 86). This may take place through homework, but at this point on the continuum, parents will be far more involved in forming the nature of that homework – it is likely to arise from conversations between parents and school staff, or to be based on the wider understanding of the student gained at the second point on the continuum. Parents at this point are engaged with the learning of their children not due to dictates from the school but because of their own perceptions of their role as parents (Peters et al. 2007)\" (p. 405).",

However, the expected direct association between school composition and school educational climate is surprisingly not significant. Rather, it is an indirect association that can be seen through others' organizational practices, such as teacher cooperation and relational climate\" (p. 151). ",
   "Assessment": "\"Because the data have a hierarchical structure with teachers nested within schools, multilevel analysis was favored to limit possible bias resulting from the dependency of the observations.

School size and location (model A; τ00 = 0.16, SE = 0.03, p ≤ 0.001) diminished the between-school variance of 30.4% when compared with the unconditional model. Among these variables, school size had no effect on expectations, while school location in a large urban center was negatively associated with expectations, but that effect disappeared when school composition variables were also added to the analysis.\nTeachers' gender, age, and the type of class taught (model A; σ2 = 0.89, SE = 0.02, p ≤ 0.001) reduced the within-school variance by less than 1% when compared with the unconditional model. Teacher gender is significantly associated with teacher expectations: Compared to women, men had more positive expectations for students' capacity to succeed. Age was marginally associated with expectations: Older teachers had fewer positive expectations than younger teachers. The type of class taught was not associated with teacher expectations\" (p. 155). \n\"Results of the bootstrapping procedure (Hayes, 2012) revealed that the direct effect of school socioeconomic composition on teacher expectations was no longer significant (direct effect β = 0.004, SE = 0.00, p > 0.05, bootstrapped 95% CI based on 5000 iterations = [−0.006; 0.015]). However, the indirect effect through school academic composition was significant (indirect effect β = −0.04, bootstrapped 95% CI based on 5000 iterations = [−0.043; −0.030]).\" (p. 155). \n\"At the school level, this model assessed the relationship between school educational climate and teacher expectations, controlling for school size and location. Results again indicated a positive relationship: A positive school educational climate raised the teachers' expectations of students. This model (model E; τ00 = 0.12, SE = 0.03, p ≤ 0.001) explained 48% of the between-school variance, when compared with the unconditional model.\" (p. 156). ",
   "Findings": "\"Although this study concludes that school environment is important in determining teacher expectations, this effect remains modest. Most of the variance in teacher expectations (nearly 80%) is associated with individual characteristics (gender, age, individual perception of school climate, and so on)\" (p. 156). \n\"school academic composition, measured according to the percentage of students with school difficulties in a given school, had the greatest effect on expectations over that of school socioeconomic and ethnic composition. First, it totally removed the influence of school socioeconomic composition and, second, it explained more than 20% of the between-school variance of teacher expectations. In keeping with other research findings suggesting that school academic composition has a greater effect than socioeconomic composition on teacher expectations, this result only confirms the importance of students' prior academic achievement for teacher expectations\" (p. 156). \n\"Although there is still a strong and well-documented association between socioeconomic status and the prevalence of academic problems, teacher expectations seem to be less influenced by socioeconomic status than by students' academic problems, which is not surprising given the high correlation between school difficulties and students' cognitive abilities \" (p. 156). \n\"This finding also reinforces the significance of students' prior academic achievement at the collective level. Teachers in schools with a large proportion of students showing no academic problems or low-level difficulties have higher expectations of their students' ability to succeed. Conversely, teacher expectations are lower in schools where students grapple with academic problems. This supports the idea that teachers are able to objectively assess their students, as teacher expectations have been found to be generally accurate and reflect students' true capacities (Jussim & Harber, 2005). However, the mechanisms underlying this accuracy of expectations toward low-ability students are still misunderstood. \" (p. 156). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"School ethnic composition had a small but significant negative effect on teacher expectations. This would indicate that teachers working in schools made up of more than 10% ethnic minorities had fewer positive expectations for students' capacity to succeed. This small effect can also be explained by the nature of the sample, given that only a few schools had a large number of ethnic minority students. Nevertheless, this is in keeping with previous findings reporting lower expectations for African-American and Latin American students, especially in low-income schools, when compared to European American and Asian American students\" (p. 156). \n\"Individual teachers' psychological climate is positively associated with their expectations for students' ability to succeed: Teachers with the best perceptions about their work environment hold the highest expectations of their students.\" (p. 156). \n\"When the school's dominant group has a high level of cultural capital, high expectations of themselves (going to college, expected years of schooling), higher academic performance and values school work, and efforts a climate of high educational expectations is reinforced. Teachers would then react to this climate of high expectations and high attainments and develop more positive expectations of their students. This adheres to the observation that school norms stem from the norms and culture of the dominant group within the school\" (p. 156). ",

   "Findings": "\"Each teacher introduced herself to the students in a way that communicated genuine interest in them. Although some teachers make perfunctory remarks about themselves in a formal introduction to their students, these teachers got “personal.”As Ms. Second said, “I don’t put on a façade. I’m just myself, and maybe they can feel the genuineness.” (p. 335). \n\"As the teachers helped students get to know one another,they also taught a core relationship lesson about the importance of respecting and being kind to one another. Ms. Second asserted, “We don’t laugh at anyone in here. You can feel very secure in this classroom.” Similarly, she said, “Will I allow you to tease someone or make fun of them? Someone might be having a bad hair day. Will we tease and make fun of them?” She used herself as an example when she drew her summer pictures on the board: “Do you promise not to laugh at my drawings? Are you sure? They’re pretty rough.” (p. 336). \n\"Building relationships and being kind to one another was a major theme during the opening of the first day. As Ms. Third explained, mutual respect was essential to “get things done.” The teachers agreed that the classroom was a happier and more productive place when teacher and students knew each other and respectfully treated each other\" (p. 337). \n\" The teachers adhered to the often-recommended approach of making expectations explicit and concrete through using clear language, modeling desired behavior, and asking students for examples. They also provided a rationale for the rules and procedures, another frequently recommended practice. Beyond these tactics, the teachers used a variety of strategies to engage students in thinking about rules and procedures, thereby avoiding what can become for students a tedious, didactic litany of “thou shalt” and “thou shalt not.” (p. 338). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"The book Ms. Third read to her students communicated messages about perseverance in the face of challenges. In I’m Going to Like Me, the narrator portrays the experience of having disappointments and making mistakes, experiences that resonate with children. The narrator also portrays a resilient disposition that enables her to bounce back and try again. In introducing the book, Ms. Third said, “I’m going to read you one of my favorite books. It’s something I like to read on the first day because it has an important message for all of us.” Her comments reinforced the message of resilience. For instance, “Everybody makes mistakes. I make mistakes all the time. Even when you do make a mistake, you can stand tall. That’s the way things will be in this class.” (p. 339). \n\"All used proactive strategies to remind students of and reinforce appropriate behavior; however, they also intervened at the first sign of behavior that did not meet their expectations and asked students to “do it better.”The tone of these interactions was critical to their effectiveness. The teachers maintained a kind and caring stance as they implemented consequences. They were upbeat, calm, and direct in their interactions, never sounding sarcastic, punitive, demeaning, or threatening\" (p. 342). \n\"Four elements of discourse style characterized the teachers’ communications. These included the use of familiar words and expressions, the use of references to popular culture, the use of call-and-response interaction patterns, and the use of straightforward directives\" (p. 342). \n\"The teachers were explicit and assertive when presenting expectations to students. Although Ms. Fifth, for instance, used an informal style sprinkled with familiar expressions and humor, she was very direct in expressing her expectations (e.g., “My hand goes up, your hand goes up.”; “I don’t tolerate fighting. I don’t tolerate fighting in my classroom. Not one bit.”)\" (p. 344). \n\"What is most interesting about Patrick et al.’s (2003) research is that students’avoidance behavior is as high in ambiguous environments as it is in nonsupportive environments. This suggests that a teacher is effective or not; there is no “almost.” Inconsistent teachers fail to support achievement motivation. This is a particularly salient point for young, White, female teachers who have been socialized to speak softly, to be nondirect, and to be nonassertive and may therefore be perceived to lack authority by African American youth\" (p. 345). \n\"Shifting the focus to the development of resilience decreases the emphasis on order and increases the emphasis on the development of a caring community. It shifts the focus of discipline from retribution to helping students feel connected\" (p. 346). ",
   "Study Limitations": "Three teachers examined, so findings may not generalize. However, the observations were quite in-depth, so a fair amount of information was gained. ",

   "Abstract": "\"Early adolescence is often marked by changes in school context, family relationships, and developmental processes. In the context of these changes, academic performance often declines, while at the same time the long-term implications of academic performance increase. In promoting achievement across elementary and secondary school levels, the significant role of families, familyschool relations, and parental involvement in education has been highlighted. Although there is a growing body of literature focusing on parental involvement in education during middle school, this research has not been systematically examined to determine which types of involvement have the strongest relation with achievement. The authors conducted a meta-analysis on the existing research on parental involvement in middle school to determine whether and which types of parental involvement are related to achievement. Across 50 studies, parental involvement was positively associated with achievement, with the exception of parental help with homework. Involvement that reflected academic socialization had the strongest positive association with achievement. Based on the known characteristics of the developmental stage and tasks of adolescence, strategies reflecting academic socialization are most consistent with the developmental stage of early adolescence.\"",

   "Theoretical Basis": "\"On the one hand, parents of high achievers engaged in frequent parent-child dialogue, strongly encouraged academic pursuits, established clear and consistent limits, and had warm and nurturing interactions with their children. Low achievers, on the other hand, hailed from families in which success equaled survival, and in which parents perceived themselves as powerless regarding their children's school performance, attributed problems to outside forces, and expressed chronic despair and hopelessness\" (p. 451).\nCook's strategies planning process: \"I- Creating a base for planning and change, II- Developing the strategic plan, III- Developing the implementation plan, IV- Implementing and monitoring th eplan, and V- Renewing the plan\" (p. 459). \nValentine's Strategic planning process: \"1- The pre=planning stage of the planning process, 2- Re-defining the organization's direction, 3- Developing the strategic mindset, 4- Implementing goals, objectives, and strategie, and 5- Reassessig and institutionalizing the change process\" (p. 459).

   "Description": "\"Although there are many organizational principles that underlie effective schools and effective home-school collaboration, there are four principles that we believe to be particularly important: (a) the need to analyze and implement home-school collaboration efforts within an ecological perspective; (b) the need to understand how parents view education and their children's school and/or school district as well as how their individual and home-based needs correlate with their children's education and educational progress; (c) the need to understand the school's true motivation for wanting to improve homeschool collaboration and its commitment to the process relative to staff knowledge, skills, resources, and persistence; and (d) the need to have an ongoing strategic planning process that guides all home-school collaborative efforts, evaluates those efforts, and adapts or institutionalizes processes as needed or warranted\" (p. 452). ",
   "Assessment": "",
   "Results": "N/A",
   "Findings": "\"Positive/High Involvement parents often are very motivated and interested in supporting the school and schooling process with their children and others. They actively participate in school activities and often recruit other parents to that end, and they are wonderful \"public relations agents\" for the school in the community and in the media. The goal with these parents is to keep them engaged, motivated, and (feeling) productive. Positive/Low Involvement parents recognize and reinforce the importance of education with their children, but their involvement typically is centered in the home and not at school. These parents often are balancing many different responsibilities, activities, and priorities at home, and thus, they respond best when the school approaches them with requests that can be accomplished at home or in conjunction with existing activities. \nNegative/Low Involvement parents often overtly or covertly communicate their dislike and distrust of the school to their children, actions that may result in a child who becomes passively or actively resistant to school and the educational process. Once these parents are identified, school personnel need to involve those resources necessary to analyze why these parents' attitudes or beliefs exist and to implement interventions to transform these attitudes and stop the potential negative impact on their children. Negative/High Involvement parents often publicize their anger and distrust of the school directly to teachers and staff, administrators and school board members, other parents, and sometimes, to the media. These parents can be very destructive--not just to their children, but also to the morale of those working in the schools. Although these parents are very difficult to \"turn around,\" they cannot be ignored, and the need to understand their negativity and the importance of successfully mediating the issues involved is critical. These parents can become strong, positive school supporters, although the problem-solving and interventions needed to accomplish such a goal often require the leadership of the building principal. In the end, change can occur when Negative/High Involvement parents' negative energy is used and transformed into positive energy. Negative/Low Involvement parents' behaviors and beliefs, however, often need more personal, pervasive, and intensive attention, and even then, long-lasting change with these parents typically comes slowly.\" (p. 454). ",
   "Findings cont": "Using Cook's Plan: \nPhase I- \"An external environmental scan and analysis is completed from an ecological perspective. That is, school personnel analyze the community's people and resources, social and demographic trends, and existing home-school-community collaboration strengths and weaknesses. Scenarios that predict future community trends and events and their impact on home-school-community collaboration are created. Additionally, logical responses to the most likely scenarios within the resources and capacity of the community are generated. \n\nAn analysis of stakeholder perceptions and expectations is completed for and with the families who live in the school's catchment area, especially focusing on those families who have school-aged children who are or will be students attending the school. Through this analysis, parents' views of education and their children's school and/or school district, their individual and home-based needs or priorities relative to their children's school and educational progress, and their current and potential school involvement can be determined. \nAn internal organizational scan and analysis is completed individually by each school to assess and understand the motivation underlying its home-school collaboration initiative and its desired short- and long-term goals and outcomes. This analysis examines issues of depth and breadth, time and resource allocation, definitions of success, and potential for longevity. It also evaluates the school's general and specific strengths or assets, weaknesses or limitations, resources or opportunities, and barriers or resistances relative to the home-school collaboration initiative and planning and implementation process. \n\nFinally, a community education or public awareness process that ties the entire planning process together is created to help the parents and community understand why strategic planning is needed, what data need to be collected and why, how trends and scenarios will be identified, and what the outcomes of the strategic planning and change process will be and at what cost (time, money, and resources). This public awareness process also may be needed for those in the school who do not understand the value and importance of a home-school collaboration initiative. In the end, this process helps to involve all of the critical stakeholders in home-school collaboration, and it reinforces the fact that the home and community are critical and equal partners in the collaborative process and will be from the very beginning. \n\nIn Phase II, the results of the external and internal analyses are analyzed, discussed, and synthesized by a planning team that represents all of the important stakeholder groups that likely will be involved or impacted by the activities when the plan is actually implemented. For example, a comprehensive needs assessment and resulting analysis may indicate that a school's parents perceive themselves as underrepresented and uninformed relative to its educational and health/mental health directions. Another school's analysis may identify a cultural gap between its teachers and the large Hispanic community and its children. In both cases, respectively, the school's planning teams would link these analyses to specific interventions by developing separate but integrated three-year and one-year homeschool collaboration plans. These plans then are reviewed by all of the critical stakeholder groups in the school, the school district, the school's homes and families, and the community--typically through a series of open community meetings (or Town Meetings) and focus group opportunities. \n\nGiven these examples, the planning team might recommend the development of a school planning and management team (Comer & Haynes, 1991) for the first analysis, and the building of a \"community of learners\" (McCaleb, 1994) for the second. In doing this, proposed three-year and one-year plans would be outlined, and then meetings would occur to reach consensus and finalize the strategic plans. In the end, each strategic plan should contain (a) a series of operational goals and goal statements; (b) a prioritization or sequencing of these goals; (c) the home, school, and/or community individuals or groups responsible for each goal; (d) a one- to three-year time frame for the completion of each goal with specific activities, resources needed, and desired outcomes; and (e) one- to three-year cost estimates for each activity needed to accomplish each goal. \n\nIn Phase III, a one-year implementation plan is formalized at the home, school, and community levels by the strategic planning team with the consensus, especially, of those individuals who will be implementing and/or involved in the plan. This plan, in essence, is simply a more specific and operationalized version of the one-year strategic plan. Thus, the plan should identify, for each operational goal or subgoal, the action steps needed to accomplish the goal, the key results expected, the individuals responsible for taking the action steps, the resources and budget needed, the timelines required for each action step (including beginning and end dates), and the evaluative process needed to determine successful goal attainment. \nIn Phase IV, the one-year strategic plan is implemented and monitored, both formatively and summatively, by the strategic planning team. If a formative evaluation suggests that it would be advantageous to adapt some timelines, budgets, responsibilities, or even some operational goals, this is done in the same planful way used to develop the original strategic plan. If a summative evaluation suggests that the second (or third) year of the original strategic plan needs to be revisited, this also can be accomplished in a timely and proactive way. Overall, Phase IV activities last for the same number of years as the more global strategic plan. Thus, in our example, Phase IV will initially involve a three-year period of implementation-the amount of time of the longest original strategic plan. Although some \"looping\" does occur between Phase IV to Phase III from year-to-year, Phase IV activity itself cycles between implementation and monitoring and back to implementation on a continuing basis. \n\nFinally, in Phase V (renewing the plan), the individual one-year and three-year plans are evaluated altogether, and the broader strategic planning process is updated and renewed. Typically, this occurs after the beginning of the third year of implementation. The focus is to analyze, understand, and build on the home, school, and community accomplishments to date; and the process requires reassessing and revalidating the strategic needs and directions of the stakeholder and constituent groups. To do this, the strategic planning team needs to reevaluate the external and internal environmental conditions that have emerged since the original development of the strategic plan and the continued viability of the various components of the interventions and activities implemented. Thus, the strategic planning team needs to revisit the initial set of strategic goals, objectives, and activities. And, finally, they need to write a new set of one- and three-year strategic plans, while renewing the commitment and energy of the home, school, and community toward the next levels of home-school collaboration and success\" (p. 459-461).

   "Findings": "\" Unlike school- and home-based involvement, academic socialization remained stable during adolescence. This strategy is developmentally appropriate as it requires direct parent-adolescent communication that emphasizes future goal orientation and the value of education balanced\n with the adolescent’s opportunity to make independent academic decisions\" (p. 1712- 1713). \n\n\"African American parents engaged in more home-based involvement and academic socialization and less schoolbased involvement (volunteerism) than their European American counterparts. Also, African American parents reduced volunteerism at a faster rate than European American parents. Despite low volunteerism, African American parents engaged in more school-based communication than European American parents. These parental involvement differences may be a result of historically racialized school experiences. Some research shows that teachers may have lower expectations of and tend to hold negative stereotypes about the intellectual ability of African American adolescents. To challenge these negative stereotypes and protect adolescents from the negative effects of lower teacher expectations, African American parents may choose to engage in more home-based involvement and academic socialization to boost adolescents’ conﬁdence and convey the importance of education and school work. Alternatively, African American parents’ own experiences of discrimination with the school system may increase their levels of involvement. Due to possible school mistrust, African American parents may engage in more schoolbased communication to monitor school personnel’s activities and demonstrate their own commitment to education to counteract negative stereotypes.\" (p. 1713). \n\n\"parents’ SES was only associated with school-based communication and volunteerism\" (p. 1713). \n\n\"boys’ parents engaged in more home-based involvement and school-based communication across middle and high school as compared to girls’ parents. Over time, parents of boys reduced schoolbased communication at a slower rate than parents of girls. In contrast, boys’ parents engaged in less school-based volunteerism than girls’ parents. Across middle and high school, parents of boys reduced volunteerism at a faster rate than parents of girls. Further, over time, parents of boys increased their use of academic socialization at a slower rate than parents of girls. Prior studies suggest that boys are less likely to have higher academic achievement (Pomerantz et al. 2002) and are at a higher risk of dropping out of school (Kena et al. 2014) than girls. Parents of boys may want to provide structure at home and supervise schoolwork to keep adolescents away from deviant behaviors and help them succeed in school. Further, parents of boys may also contact school personnel more often to monitor their adolescents’ behaviors, progress in school, and learn how to assist with homework (Lareau 1996). In contrast, girls’ parents may not feel the need to contact school personnel to check on their daughters, but they may instead volunteer to establish relationships with other parents and learn about educational opportunities outside the school that may help their daughters continue to excel. Further, given that girls are more likely to perform better in school than boys (Pomerantz et al. 2002), parents of girls tend to have higher academic expectations than parents of boys (Carter and Wojtkiewicz 2000), and may therefore increasingly engage in academic socialization across middle and high school.\" (p. 1713). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Neighborhood disadvantage was positively associated with home-based involvement and academic socialization whereas institutional resources were negatively associated with change in academic socialization over time. Parents engaged in more home-based involvement and academic socialization if they lived in more disadvantaged neighborhoods. Further, parents in more resourced neighborhoods engaged in academic socialization at a slower rate than their counterparts. In other words, over time, parents in less resourced neighborhoods more frequently used academic socialization strategies and surpassed their counterparts by 11th grade. Due to stressful living environments, parents in disadvantaged neighborhoods may engage in more restrictive and controlling parenting strategies at home. For parental involvement, this may mean more monitoring of youth behavior and less opportunities to interact in the neighborhood, which may result in more chances for home-based structured academic activities. Relatedly, even though research suggests that parents in disadvantaged neighborhoods are less likely to communicate with their children, education-speciﬁc discussions among these parents and their children may be likely. Parents in disadvantaged neighborhoods may work intensely to communicate to their children the value and importance of education as a means to get out of the neighborhood or increase their human, social, and ﬁnancial capital\" (p. 1714). \n\n\" The presence of neighborhood institutional structures enhanced parents’ volunteerism, whereas, positive perceptions of neighborhood cohesion and trust reduced school-based communication. If parents are accustomed to positive, supportive relationships in their neighborhoods, they may be less likely to interact with school personnel if the quality of the communication is negative, hostile, or problem-focused. Given school bureaucracies, preventative, positive communication between home and school is often difﬁcult to achieve during middle and high school. Further, in supportive, cohesive neighborhoods, parents may rely on their social networks, rather than school personnel,to get tangible, informational support to assist with school-related problems and choices\" (p. 1714).

   "Study Limitations": "The study only focuses on two ethnic groups: African- American and European- American, and therefore certain findings may not generalize to other populations. \n\nWith secondary data analysis, the data collected have come from previously established scales and some scales had very few items. \n\nMore work to be done focusing on what behaviors are present in these types of involvement.

   "Description": "",
   "Assessment": "Uses latent growth-curve modeling",
   "Results": "\"Contrary to expectations, the downward trend in academic orientation seen for all stu dents is driven by the higher-track students. Initially, college-preparatory students have the highest level of academic orientation (inter cept = 2.89, p < .001), but they become less oriented to school over time (slope = -.06, p < .001). General students start out somewhat less oriented to school, but they also experi ence a significant decline in orientation. Remedial students begin school with the low est level of academic orientation, but, unlike their higher-track counterparts, they remain relatively constant in their orientation over time. In all tracks, initial academic orientation is not correlated with change in orientation over time\" (p. 218). \n\n\"More in line with expectations, the down ward trend in parental involvement, for all students, is also driven by the parents of col lege-preparatory students. These parents are the most involved when their adolescents enter high school (intercept = 2.18, p < .001), but their involvement drops across their ado lescents' high school careers (slope = -.08, p < .001). The general-track students have more involved parents than do the remedial stu dents, but the parents of neither of these groups decrease their involvement across three years. By the end of high school, the involvement of parents of college-preparatory students falls between the involvement of parents of students in the general and reme dial tracks. These curricular differences do not change when probability levels are adjusted for multiple comparisons\" (p. 221). ",
   "Findings": "\" When students are doing well in school, their parents see less need to monitor their progress, have less motivation to engage actively in school-related activities, and have less reason to meet with teachers, whereas when students are having trouble in school, their parents may be more likely to become involved\" (p. 212). \n\n\"Past research reporting that the parents of higher-track students are the most involved in their adolescents' educational careers has missed an important point: This advantage of college-preparatory students may diminish or even disappear as high school progresses. Snapshots of parental involvement at only one point in time obscure such trends. In sum, trajectories of both academic orienta tion and parental involvement are embedded in the structure of schools\" (p. 222). \n\n\" Across tracks, three factors predict the starting level of academic orientation: African American status (compared to white), achievement level, and test scores. Being\n African American predicts higher academic orientation in the two higher tracks, but group modeling reveals that these parameter estimates do not differ significantly. Test per formance predicts higher orientation for gen eral-track students only, but again, this para meter estimate is not significantly different from those for the other tracks. Finally, in all tracks, higher grades predict greater orienta tion. Students who are receiving better grades, according to their official transcripts, are more oriented toward school.\" (p. 222). \n\n\" Regarding gender, girls are more likely to have involved parents, controlling for other factors, in the remedial track, but they are less likely to have involved parents in the two higher tracks, especially in the general track. Breaking down involvement into its con stituent behaviors (these results are summa rized but not shown in tabular form) reveals a more nuanced picture of this gender differ ence. The lower involvement of girls' parents in the higher tracks seems to be confined to more active behaviors: helping with home work, attending parent-teacher programs and sporting or extracurricular events, and helping with course selection. Apparently, as the curricular status of boys increases, their parents take a more active role in their edu cation. For ethnicity, African American adolescents have more involved parents than do white adolescents in all tracks, though this relation ship reaches significance only in the remedial track. For these lowest-status students, African American parents take a more active role than do white parents. Asian Americans have more involved parents than do whites in the remedial track, but less involved parents in the two higher tracks. This difference across tracks is statistically significant. The lower involvement of the Asian American par ents of higher-track students, especially col lege-preparatory students, cuts across almost all types of involvement. Unless their adoles cents are in remedial classes, Asian American parents stand at a greater distance from the schooling process. For family background, two factors gener ally predict higher parental involvement, of all types, in all three tracks: coming from an intact family and having more educated par ents. Finally, the positive relationship between academic achievement and greater parental involvement characterizes college-preparato ry students only. This trend is especially true for three behaviors: helping with homework, knowing how the adolescent is doing in school, and helping with course selection. These behaviors probably reflect parents' long-term educational goals for adolescents \" (p. 222). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Three factors predict the rate of change in parental involvement: African American or Hispanic American status (compared to white) and achievement. Being a member of a disadvantaged minority negatively predicts the rate of change in parental involvement in the remedial track only and is not related to change in the two higher tracks. This trend centers on one behavior: helping with course selection. Because the overall slope of involve ment for remedial students is zero, these neg ative relationships indicate that remedial stu dents of these two ethnicities have parents who become less involved in their education al careers over time. Thus, the overall tenden cy for parents of remedial students to main tain a constant level of involvement across three years is primarily a white phenomenon. Academic achievement negatively predicts the rate of change in parental involvement in the college-preparatory track only. Because the overall slope of parental involvement is negative for college-preparatory students, this negative relationship indicates that achievement is related to the slope in involve ment becoming even more negative (or more steeply negative). This trend appears only when the general phenomenon of parental involvement, not the individual behaviors, is examined. Overall, parents of college preparatory students become less involved in their adolescents' educational careers over time, even more so when their adolescents are doing well in school\" (p. 225). \n\n\" Interestingly, these findings for the overall composite do not hold for the one involve ment behavior that demonstrates a signifi cant variance in slope within tracks. In all tracks, initial academic orientation is not sig nificantly related to changes in parental help ing with course selection over time. The rela tionship between initial orientation and changes in parental behavior over time char acterizes the general phenomenon of involve ment, rather than specific types of involve ment. Thus, trajectories in academic orientation and parental involvement are intertwined over the course of high school, but only in the non-college-preparatory tracks. For these stu\n dents, parents appear more responsive to their adolescents' feelings about school. Lower-track students who value education may actively engage their parents in the edu cational process, and their parents may become more excited about helping them reach their goals. This relationship may be less true of college-preparatory students, for whom such involvement is more normative.\" (p. 227). ",

Lower- track students may have had difficulty for  a while and do not see their efforts as leading to anything fruitful.

   "Extended Population Characteristics": "\"Study participants in the sample were part of a multiwave longitudinal study designed to increase understanding of the inﬂuences of sociocultural context on academic and psychological development during adolescence. Participants were from 10 public high schools within a large, socioeconomically diverse city in the United States. The racial composition of the schools was approximately 66% European American students, 26% African American students, and 8% other racial minority students. This study examines three waves of data: Wave 1 (N = 1,056) collected in the fall of 10th grade, Wave 2( N = 1,052) collected in the spring of 10th grade, and Wave 3 (N = 935) collected in the spring of 11th grade.

   "Theoretical Basis": "\"Self-system theory (Skinner, Kindermann, Connell, & Wellborn, 2009), a motivational framework grounded in self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000), was used to understand how both the\nhome and school environments interact to inﬂuence adolescent academic and emotional functioning. Self-system theory is a mediational model linking contextual characteristics to patterns of action (e.g., engagement vs. disengagement) through an individual’s appraisals of how competent, autonomous, and related he or she feels within particular contexts (Connell & Wellborn, 1991). Drawing on this theoretical framework, parents create opportunities for adolescents to engage in a variety of educational activities (Skinner & Wellborn, 1994). The experiential quality of the activity and interaction with parents provides adolescents with information about themselves as being competent to succeed, as being autonomous learners, as being related to others in these settings, and as having opportunities to fulﬁll their personal goals. This information cumulates to inﬂuence adolescents’ engagement across various educational activities and throughout their future development. As such, parenting practices that fulﬁll adolescents’ psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness increase school engagement, which in turn promotes positive adolescent outcomes (Eccles et al., 1993; Skinner & Wellborn, 1994). Conversely, parenting practices that conﬂict with adolescents’ psychological needs can result in disengagement from learning and further undermine academic and emotional functioning (Wang & Eccles, 2012b).\" (p. 611). ",
   "Description": "\"To extract the unique contribution of each parent involvement strategy, we conceptualized parental involvement as: attending school events and volunteering in school (a form of school-based involvement), provision of structure and resources for homework and after-school time (a form of home-based involvement), and communicating parental expectations for education and making preparations and plans for the future (a form of academic socialization).\" (p. 612). ",
   "Assessment": "Scales used demonstrated good internal reliability.\n\nMeans, standard deviations, and bivariate correlations computed",
   "Results": "\"The mean for each type of parental involvement suggested that, overall, parents showed more home-based involvement and academic socialization than school-based involvement at 10th grade. African American parents reported more home-based involvement (African American = 3.79, European American = 3.65), t(1,055) = 3.47, p < .001, and less school-based involvement (African American = 1.56, European American = 2.28), t(1,055) = 21.45, p < .001, than European American parents. No ethnic differences in academic socialization were found.

School-based involvement and academic socialization were negatively associated with depression (cs = .15 and .19, respectively), whereas home-based involvement was not associated with depression\" (p. 617). \n\n\" Home-based involvement and academic socialization were positively associated with behavioral engagement (cs = .16 and .19, respectively), whereas school-based involvement and academic socialization were positively associated with emotional engagement (cs = .13 and .22, respectively). Moreover, the association between home-based involvement and achievement was partially mediated by behavioral engagement, and the association between academic socialization and achievement was partially mediated by behavioral and emotional engagement. The associations between school-based involvement and academic socialization and depression were partially mediated by emotional engagement. Taken together, academic socialization inﬂuenced achievement indirectly through both behavioral and emotional engagement in school. Academic socialization and school-based involvement inﬂuenced depression directly and also indirectly through emotional engagement in school. Home-based involvement inﬂuenced academic achievement\ndirectly and indirectly through behavioral engagement\" (p. 617- 618). \n",
   "Findings": "\" We found that parental involvement in 10t;h grade improved not only academic but also emotional functioning among adolescents in 11th grade. However, the effects of parental involvement on achievement and depression varied by the type of involvement in which parents engaged. For instance, among the types of parental involvement, academic socialization had the strongest positive relation with achievement and strongest negative relation with depression. In addition, we extended past research on the application of self-system theory to identify the processes by which different parental involvement strategies inﬂuence adolescent achievement and depression. Speciﬁcally, parent involvement in education predicted student academic success and mental health both directly and indirectly through behavioral and emotional engagement. Finally, the examination of moderation effect of ethnicity and SES contributes to our understanding that the effects of parental involvement on adolescent outcomes did not differ for ethnicity, but did differ for SES. The association between academic socialization and achievement was mediated by student behavioral and emotional engagement. In other words, parents who conveyed the importance and value of education and discussed future plans with their children motivated them to engage in their academic work behaviorally and emotionally. In turn, this behavioral and emotional engagement in school led to higher achievement. Furthermore, the provision of appropriate structure and an intellectually supportive home environment was found to have a positive association with achievement through behavioral engagement. On the other hand, this study indicates that simply requiring parents to spend time at school (i.e., volunteering) may not result in achievement gains among high school students. One possible explanation of this is that parents come to school or attend parent–teacher conferences for a variety of reasons, including dealing with nonacademic issues (e.g., behavior management). Thus, school-based involvement may not directly relate to student academic performance. Another possible explanation is that the involvement opportunities available to parents in high school are typically restricted to administrative or extracurricular duties. The hectic nature of high schools containing multiple teachers have made it difﬁcult to accommodate parents in the classroom\" (p. 619- 620). \n\n\"However, although attending parent–teacher conferences and volunteering at school appear to have no direct effect on achievement in high school, our ﬁndings show that there are still emotional beneﬁts to students whose parents are involved in school activities. Indeed, there is evidence that the affective nature of parental school-based involvement supports adolescent mental health (Pomerantz, Ng, & Wang, 2006; Pomerantz, Wang, & Ng, 2005). It is plausible that parents who are actively involved in their children’s school activities convey the message that they place greater importance and value on their children’s school progress and overall well-being (Grolnick & Slowiaczek, 1994). Thus, despite adolescents’ self-sufﬁcient attitude, when parents simply attend school events or volunteer at school, for example, they may provide adolescents with a sense of caring, support, and connection to their parents. While parents must remain mindful not to encroach on students’ feelings of independence, the tangible activities of school-based involvement may help adolescents in establishing emotional closeness with parents, which can help the student construct positive representations of self \" (p. 620). \n\n\" In addition, parent involvement through academic socialization may provide students with an effective coping strategy for dealing with challenges that school presents (Pomerantz et al., 2006). Research indicates that by discussing future educational plans with children, parents model a coping mechanism in which they take control of the situation—a technique that creates positive changes in mental health (Grolnick & Slowiaczek, 1994). This type of lesson in active coping strategy could lead to lower levels of depressive symptoms, possibly through increasing adolescents’ academic self-efﬁcacy and reducing any sense of learned helplessness\" (p. 621). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"we found some evidence of ethnic differences in home-based and schoolbased involvement. While European American parents reported more frequent school involvement than African American parents, African American parents tended to be more involved in their children’s education from home than European American parents. The ﬁnding that African American parents in our study reported relatively low involvement within the school setting seems to support Hill and Taylor’s (2004) argument that cultural beliefs and negative historical experiences with the public school system may deter African American parents from being involved in school. In addition, European American parents may feel more comfortable with being involved in school because of their generally high representation within the educational system, their knowledge of how it operates (Lareau, 2003), and their perceptions of social expectations to do so. However, even though the mean levels of home and school involvement differed between European American and African American parents, the strengths of the longitudinal associations among parent involvement, academic engagement, and adolescent achievement and depression were similar across these two ethnic groups. Overall, these results encouragingly suggest that the effects of each type of parental involvement on adolescents identiﬁed in this study can be applied to both ethnic groups, although European American and African American parents may have different approaches to engaging in their children’s education\" (p. 621). \n\n\"In addition, academic socialization was found to be more strongly related to emotional engagement among lower SES students than among higher SES students. Adolescents growing up in disadvantaged communities may have less exposure to information about college or positive educational role models, making it especially important for their parents to convey the value of education and discuss plans to fulﬁll future goals. Such conversations can help adolescents feel that their time spent at school is meaningful and stimulate more positive attitudes toward education, which may lead to improved achievement in the future\" (p. 621). \n\n",

   "Findings": "\"Student views on parental involvement variables were not correlated with family structure and parental education level- a result that was unexpected given the significant literature base that finds that background impacts student success. Our findings provide evidence of adolescents' willingness to support parental involvement across various family structures and parental education levels\" (p. 228). \n\n\"Results indicate that adolescents are in favour of supporting most parental involvement in schooling, except for two of them. More precisely, they appear to be reluctant to support parents' visits of their classes and parents' participation in a class trip. On the other hand, over 80% of them are willing to show their parent something they learned or did well, to ask a parent to give them some ideas for a story or project, to have a parent tell them about when he/ she was a teenager, and to bring home notes, notices, or a newsletter from school\" (p. 228). \n\n\"Many of the listed activities represent opportunities for parents to provide affective support, that is, to give encouragement, praise, to help with homework, to discuss about courses and to attend activities at school as an audience, and to discuss with their adolescent about their future. Even though no meaningful discrepancy was previously reported with girls' and boys' levels of parental affective support, girls' greater willingness to support these activities could reflect a greater desire to feel loved and close to their parents. It could also reflect girls' greater openness to parental influence... A plausible explanation could then be that parental affective support, even though present at the same level, is more beneficial for girls than for boys because of their greater susceptibility to parental influence\" (p. 228-229). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Our data seem to suggest that even though most of the parental involvement activities receive support, the adolescents' maturity level explain in part the likelihood of their support. For example, if adolescents describe themselves as haiving a positive self- image (high identity level\" and as being hard workers (high work orientation level), they are most likely to be interested in interviewing their parents for some information or opinions or to discuss about next year's courses\" (p. 230).

   "Findings": "\"In his review of the literature on parental disciplinary techniques, Martin Hoffman (1970) pointed out that disciplinary strategies might or might not include what he called “induction.” He deﬁned induction as parents’ provision of explanations (i.e.,reasoning) with respect to their actions, values, and disciplinary behaviors. Hoffman suggested that parents’ use of induction encourages children to focus on learning the reasons behind their parents’ actions. Furthermore, he pointed out that parents’ reasoning with respect to their disciplinary actions might include explanations of the inﬂuence of the child’s behavior on other people, which Hoffman called “otheroriented induction.” He contended that other-oriented induction enables children to realize the inﬂuences and consequences of their behaviors on others (e.g., peers, siblings, teachers). Hoffman (1970) concluded that parental use of induction was positively related to children’s internalization of parental values (deﬁned as moral judgements depicting an internal versus external orientation) and to their development of altruism and moral reasoning. He suggested that parents’ explanations of their actions to their children help them better understand their parents’ cognitive thought processing, thus facilitating the transfer of values from parent to child. In addition, he suggested that other oriented induction techniques (i.e., the child’s realization of their inﬂuence on others) facilitate children’s development of empathy\" (p. 133). \n\n\"Sears and his colleagues classiﬁed maternal disciplinary techniques into one of two distinct types: love-oriented and object-oriented. The love-oriented style, as described by Sears et al.(1957),consistedof maternal use of warmth, praise, and emotional affection (and withdrawal of these) to respond to their children’s behaviors. The object-oriented style consisted of maternal use (and withdrawal) of tangible objects, such as toys or extra playtime, to respond to their children’s behavior. In examining the effects of these disciplinary styles on child development, Sears et al. (1957) found that these disciplinary styles uniquely impacted children’s internalization of their parents’ values. Speciﬁcally, they found that children of parents who used a love-oriented disciplinary approach were more likely to internalize the values of their parents (i.e., take on the values as their own) than children of parents who used an object-oriented disciplinary style. They also found that parental use of love-oriented strategies was associated with children’s display of self-control and self-regulation\" (p. 132). \n\n\" One of the ﬁrst studies in this series found that parents who displayed higher levels of authoritative parenting by providing their children with warmth, autonomy, and high maturity demands had children with higher achievement levels (Steinberg et al., 1989). In another study, Steinberg et al. (1992) found that authoritative parenting was related to adolescent grade point average (GPA) and school engagement. These ﬁndings have led researchers to ask why authoritative parenting styles are associated with positive school outcomes. In a review of these ﬁndings, Durkin (1995) cites three reasons why authoritative parenting might be related to positive child outcomes. First, he suggests that authoritative parents provide a high level of emotional security that provides their children with a sense of comfort and independence and helps them succeed in school. Second, he suggests that authoritative parents provide their children with explanations for their actions. Explanations provide children with a sense of awareness and understanding of their parents’ values, morals, and goals. The transmission of these goals and values equips these students with the tools needed to perform well in school. Third, he suggests that authoritative parents engage in bidirection communication with their children. This communication style nurtures skills in interpersonal relations and produces better adjusted and more popular children. These interpersonal skills, he suggests, helps children succeed in school, both socially and academically. Despite the reasons cited by Durkin (1995) above, research has shown that the relationship between authoritative parenting and school achievement is not consistent across families from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Several studies, for example, have found differences for African American, Hispanic, and Asian children. Speciﬁcally, Baumrind (1972) found that authoritarian parenting, although eliciting fear and compliance in White children, elicited assertiveness in African American females. Dornbusch et al. (1987) found that authoritative parenting was associated with GPA for White families but not for Asian, Black, or Hispanic families. The researchers also found that authoritarian parenting was negatively associated with GPA for Asian and White families but not for Black or Hispanic families. In another study, Steinberg et al. (1992) found that authoritative parenting was highly correlated withadolescent GPA and engagement in school with two notable exceptions: (1) for African American adolescents, there was no relationship between authoritative parenting and adolescent achievement and engagement; (2) for Hispanic adolescents, authoritarian parenting was highly related to adolescent engagement,whereas the effect was relatively weak for other subgroups.\" (p. 136). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Darling and Steinberg’s (1993) model provides three ways to help explain the discrepancies in the literature. The ﬁrst possibility is that parents of different ethnicities hold unique educational aspirations, goals, and values for their children, and therefore enact unique parenting practices. Research indicates, however, that parental aspirations, values, and goals for their children do not vary dramatically by ethnicity. A second possibility is that socioeconomic status moderates the relationship between parental socialization goals for their children and parental practices. Evidence to support this hypothesis would suggest that the contextual model should expand its notion of context toward the larger cultural and economic context in which families reside. Although this hypothesis seems plausible, little research to date has examined its potential moderating effect. Finally, a third\npossibility is that parenting styles serve as a moderator between parenting practices and adolescent outcomes, resulting in distinct outcomes dependent upon the combinations of parenting styles and practices.\" (p. 141- 142).

We also examined whether these associations were similar for girls and boys. Mothers’ academic involvement predicted boys’ grade point average (GPA) and preparation for postsecondary education for girls and boys.

Fathers’ academic involvement positively predicted girls’ preparation for postsecondary education, but only if their daughters perceived them to have lower levels of harshness parenting. Fathers’ involvement was negatively linked with daughters’ preparation for postsecondary education if they perceived higher levels of harshness from fathers.

   "Findings": "\"Accumulating research within ethnic groups that value traditional gender roles has found that parents treat daughters and sons differently (Updegraff, Delgado, & Wheeler, 2009). In Mexican-origin families particularly, girls may be expected to emphasize family responsibilities to a greater extent than boys (Stein et al., 2014). These filial obligations have been linked with higher grades if adolescents view achievement as a means to helping their family (Fuligni & Fuligni, 2007). In fact, Latina adolescents have reported higher economic value of education, which partially explained gender differences in GPA\" (p. 389). \n\n\"Results suggest that parents’ academic-related behaviors, and not merely their educational values or knowledge about academics, influence the subsequent academic performance and investment of Mexican-origin students in high school. Importantly, significant associations revealed differences by adolescent gender and adolescents’ perceptions of their fathers’ harsh parenting. Mothers’ academic involvement predicted GPA for boys, and preparation for postsecondary education for girls and boys. Surprisingly, neither mothers’ nor fathers’ academic involvement predicted girls’ GPA. Fathers’ academic involvement, however, positively predicted girls’ preparation for postsecondary education but only if their daughters perceived them to have lower levels of harsh parenting. Conversely, fathers’ academic involvement was positively linked with boys’ GPA and preparation for postsecondary education if their sons perceived their fathers to have higher or average levels of harshness. If sons perceived lower levels of harshness, fathers’ academic involvement was not associated with achievement. Studies examining Mexican-origin fathers is limited (Ceballo et al., 2017) but proved important in the current study.\" (p. 394). \n\n\"Parents’ academic involvement efforts seemed to be especially beneficial for their sons. Latino adolescent boys show lower achievement levels (i.e., reading scores, dropout rates, college enrollment and completion) than their Latina peers at all levels of education (Kena et al., 2015). These gender disparities are likely catalyzed by an amalgamation of factors such as familial norms and discrimination (McGill, Hughes, Alicea, & Way, 2012). Latino adolescent boys may have fewer opportunities to develop positive feelings about education given that they receive lower academic expectations and support from school personnel, relative to Latinas, which, in turn, could be associated with lower academic self-concept\" (p. 394). \n\n\"We found that fathers may especially adjust their parenting strategies in relation to their children’s schooling depending on the gender of their child. In contrast to mothers, who showed similar levels of academic involvement in relation to their sons and daughters, fathers showed higher levels of academic involvement with their sons. Prior research finds that Latino boys face disproportionately high disciplinary actions (Gregory, Skiba, & Noguera, 2010) and that fathers intervene during disciplinary actions (Lareau, 2003). Fathers’ academic involvement could have been linked with their sons’ achievement when paired with boys’ perceptions of average and higher levels of harshness because fathers were intervening during disciplinary actions. Fathers may have been combining these strategies to keep boys on track academically, and this type of involvement may be interpreted by boys as a sign of their fathers’ concern and higher educational expectations. Conversely, father’s involvement facilitated gains in girls’ preparation for postsecondary education only when coupled with lower levels of harshness, as reported by their daughters. These gender differences are consistent with prior research suggesting that parents influence their daughters more through encouragement but through pressure with sons\" (p. 394). ",

   "Abstract": "\"Objectives The transition to adolescence is associated with decreases in student achievement. One factor that may mitigate these decreases is parent involvement. The present study examined whether ethnicity, type of involvement (school-based involvement [SBI] vs. home-based involvement [HBI]), and their interaction predicted GPA. Methods This study, using data from the High School Longitudinal Study, examined whether type of involvement (SBI vs. HBI) and ethnicity predicted adolescents’ grade point average (GPA). Employing random coefﬁcient growth curve modelling, we examined whether time, ethnicity, and SBI and HBI at grade 9 predicted adolescents’ levels of GPA from grade 9 to 12. Results The initial effect of time (from grade 9 to grade 10) was signiﬁcant, with GPA declining across ethnic groups. The initial decline attenuated from grades 10 to 12. With the exception of Asian Americans, SBI was signiﬁcantly positively associated with GPA. Over and above SBI, HBI was consistently positively associated with subsequent GPA across ethnic groups. These associations of SBI and HBI with GPA persisted across time. Conclusions The ﬁndings are consistent with past research, although that research did not examine HBI and SBI simultaneously, high school students speciﬁcally, and GPA over time. The non-signiﬁcant association of GPA with SBI for Asian Americans may be due to different peer processes and beliefs about education. Because HBI has similar associations across groups, and because it predicts unique variance in GPA over and above SBI, it may be important for parents of high schoolers to pursue, regardless of ethnicity.\"",

Third, does distal home-based involvement signiﬁcantly predict students’ GPA over and above the predictive value of schoolbased involvement? We hypothesize that it does. Finally, does the predictive value of the two types of parental involvement persist over time? We hypothesize that that levels of parental involvement at grade 9 would be stronger predictors of GPA in grade 9 than in grade 12.\" (p. 3002). ",

For both types of involvement, African American and European Americans reported higher levels of involvement than did Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans. African American and European Americans did not differ in their levels of involvement, and Asian and Hispanic Americans also did not differ from each other. Thus, contrary to prior research and to our expectations, African American and European American groups did not differ in school-based involvement or home-based involvement. Furthermore, those groups lower on school-based involvement also scored lower on home-based involvement\" (p. 3003). \n\n\"Furthermore, the following control variables did not signiﬁcantly predict GPA when entered in the model and were thus removed from the ﬁnal model: whether or not there were at least 2 caregivers in the home, whether English was spoken at home, and whether both parents were born in the USA.\" (p. 395). \n\n\"Regarding our second question (whether there would be ethnic differences in associations between school-based involvement and GPA), the term for the interaction between ethnic group and school-based involvement was signiﬁcant,\nF(3, 13,000)=11.29, p<0.001. Probes revealed that the effect of school-based involvement was signiﬁcantly positive for the African American, Hispanic American, and European American groups, and that the effect size was not signiﬁcantly different for these three groups. However, the effect of school-based involvement was non-signiﬁcant for the Asian American group; this effect was signiﬁcantly different from the other three groups. Also pertinent to our second question, the interaction term for ethnicity and home-based involvement was not signiﬁcant and was removed from the model. However, pertinent to our third question (if distal home-based involvement would signiﬁcantly predict GPA over and above school-based involvement), the effect for home-based involvement was indeed signiﬁcant, F(1, 13,000)=5.05, p<0.03. Finally, pertinent to our fourth question (whether the predictive value of the two types of parental involvement would persist over time), the interaction terms for parental involvement with time were not signiﬁcant and was removed from the model. This means that school-based and\nFig. 1 Levels of GPA over time as a function of age, ethnicity, and school-based caregiver involvement\nhome-based involvement, measured in grade 9, predicted variations in GPA as strongly in grade 12 as they did in grade 9.\" (p. 3006).

   "Findings cont": "\"SBI was not signiﬁcantly associated with GPA for Asian American participants, and this association was signiﬁcantly different than the positive association between SBI and GPA for Hispanic Americans, African Americans and European Americans.

Steinberg et al. (1992) report that Asian American students are more likely than students in other groups to believe that not getting a good education will have negative consequences on their job prospects; this variable in turn tends to be predictive of school achievement. Asian American parents may be likely to promote this type of belief. These values may supersede any effects of parental involvement\" (p.  3007). \n\n\"It is notable that ethnicity did not moderate the positive association of distal HBI with GPA, however.

Your standards are going to be what the community values.\" Another mem ber of the School B partnership committee com mented, \"If we did not have as much commu nity support, we would not have such a good system.\" Partnership leaders at School C found that their work with the community has paid off in resources for school improvement, and also has had positive results for the community, a third motivating factor for community involve ment at these high schools. Supporting Community Development Just as the partnership leaders viewed a strong community as critical for a strong school, they also viewed community involvement in their schools as a way to help build stronger commu nities. They viewed community involvement as a way to encourage students to return to their communities as productive citizens after com pleting their educations. The principal at School C explained: The kids must understand that the com munity does like them and that they are willing to help out. If they know that the community is willing to help out, then possibly those children, when they gradu ate, are going to be more willing to come back and help add to the community. It is that sense of family that is very important. This sentiment also was expressed by a member of School As partnership team. She observed: \"It would be nice if these kids would stay as educated people and contribute to this neigh borhood, make it work, get some businesses going.\"\n Beyond ensuring the communities' future vital ity and strength, partnership leaders at the case high schools also saw their community partner ship activities as a way to provide immediate services to the community. School C, for example, has conducted a number of partnership activities, such as the community health fair, that provide needed services to community members. School C also has encouraged, organized, and rewarded students for community volunteering. The principal at School C noted: We pay attention to students who do com munity service. We offer a scholarship every year, the biggest criteria for that is somebody that goes out within the com munity and volunteers their time. The time is what people need. Such volunteerism was also present among the school faculty, who at both School A and School C have been recognized for the time they give to support community growth and devel opment. Leaders at School B viewed the cultural and literary events that they co-sponsored as a way to give back to the community by forging closer community ties. These schools, thus, viewed community involvement as a means to get resources, as well as to give them. These dif ferent motivations for community partnership development - (1) improving student academic and personal success, (2) enhancing school quality, and (3) supporting community deveopment - were reflected in the activities implemented at the case high schools.\" (p. 6). \n\n\" Common among the student-focused activities were student scholarships, awards for service, tutoring and mentoring programs, mock interviews, and job-shadowing programs. School focused partnership activities included events such as fundraising projects for school equipment and building improvements, and resulted in refreshments, chaperones, hall monitors, guest speakers, and other volunteers for school events. Family-focused community partnership activities included workshops, and family incentives and awards. Community-focused activities included co-sponsored cultural events, community health fairs, advertisements in monthly school newsletters, food drives, and other volunteer activities that benefited community members\" (p. 8).\n\n\"A partnership committee member at School C suggested that schools must have a \"clearly defined mission.\" Once the mission is defined, a partnership committee member at School B advised schools to, \"Start small with a needs assessment, strong leader, small dedicated committee, a strategic plan, clear action steps, and an ongo ing, continual yearly evaluation process.\" Case school leaders warn schools against short changing this process to achieve quick results. A partnership committee member at School A observed, \"You know sometimes when people try to plan something and take on a new initiative, they want to do it big. . . . [B]ut it has to grow from something. The roots need to be there.\"\n Second, leaders from the case schools empha sized the importance of permitting the necessary time for partnership program development. One leader observed: \"They need to take the time; they have to be dedicated.\" Another urged: \"Don't give up after the first couple of months of trying. Initially it looks like a big undertaking, but don't be discouraged.\" Time is needed for identifying school and community needs, contacting potential community partners, attending planning meetings, and evaluat ing and reflecting on past activities in order to better design future ones. \"(p. 8).",

   "Theoretical Basis": "\"Research on the ways in which parents inﬂuence child development may be loosely described as falling into two broad perspectives (Kellaghan, Sloane, Alvarez, & Bloom, 1993). The “what parents do” perspective emphasizes behavioral features of parent–child relationships and encompasses a number of speciﬁc research paradigms. In contrast, the “who parents are” perspective generally focuses on the sociodemographic, biological, and contextual characteristics of individual parents and the ways in which these characteristics correlate with children’s academic outcomes. A growing number of research studies combine features of each perspective, but much of the extant literature may be categorized as focusing on one perspective or the other.\" (p. 164). \n\nEpstein's framework",

   "Results": "\" Findings suggested that, depending on ethnicity, there are differences in the impact of an authoritarian parent style. Specifically, authoritative parenting and peer support for academic achievement served a protective function for academic achievement among European American students. Among Asian American students, however, peer support seemed to offset the negative consequences of authoritarian parenting; thus, authoritarian parenting in itself was not necessarily a risk factor. Among African American students in this sample, authoritative parenting was not associated with academic achievement in the absence of peer support for achievement, suggesting that parenting styles may function differently depending on family ethnicity\" (p. 165). ",
   "Findings": "\"Many speciﬁc features of the home environment are inﬂuential in shaping child outcomes. One such feature is the communication style used by parents. The ways in which parents interact with their children greatly affect later social competencies, and reﬂection-enhancing communication is considered to be an especially effective form of parent–child communication. In this type of communication, parental messages encourage children to think about the causes and effects of their actions. These messages enable the child to engage in processing how an action emerges from, and also serves to create, the affective and psychological environment that follows the action. Parents engage in explicit encouragement of reﬂection when they encourage their children to think about causes and consequences of their behavior as explicitly stated by the parents. After children examine the causes and consequences of their behavior, they will be able to modify that behavior.\" (p. 167). \n\n\" In 1998, the National Standards for Parent/Family Involvement Programs (National PTA, 1998, 2000) were developed, providing a set of guidelines to be used by schools and families to implement parental involvement strategies. \" (p. 169). \n\n\" In one study of cultural models of school achievement, it was found that immigrant Latino parents believed that children reach the “age of reason” at approximately 5 years, and therefore few parents believed in engaging in reading with their children before this age (Gallimore & Goldenberg, 2001). In the same study, interviews with parents showed that rather than emphasizing children’s emergent literacy, the cultural perspective of these parents emphasized the importance of children’s moral development. That is, early reading activities were viewed as being of relatively low priority in comparison with teaching children good manners and the difference between right and wrong (Gallimore & Goldenberg, 2001). Rather than making broad generalizations about immigrant Latino parents not valuing reading to young children, it would be more culturally sensitive to attempt to understand what such parents do value and to gather information about how others view what we would consider standard mainstream values (e.g., reading to young children; Eccles & Harold, 1996). This way, culturally informed strategies for promoting positive outcomes for children in school settings can be developed. \" (p. 170). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Several areas of research and theory provide support for the notion that parents’ own experiences in school may be an important factor in understanding parenting behaviors related to children’s education. It has been suggested that childhood memories are “reactivated” as parents prepare their own children for similar experiences (Putallaz, Costanzo, & Klein, 1993) and that parents use recollections of their own childhood experiences to interpret and direct their children’s experiences (Putallaz, Costanzo, & Smith, 1991). Parents who characterize their school experiences as warm, positive, and supportive may have an internal “working model” according to which schools are positive places for their children. In contrast, parents who characterize their school experiences as negative and thus view schools as hostile, unfair, or rejecting may have negative “working models” of school.\" (p. 171). \n\n\"Social learning theory provides one explanation for the intergenerational transmission of less than optimal parenting practices. Abusive behavior may be modeled by parents such that their children are likely to learn these models and grow up to rely on them in handling difﬁcult situations later in life (Hertzberger, 1983). Abused children may develop schemas about appropriate and inappropriate child behavior that surface during the transition to parenthood. Attachment theory has also been asserted as an explanation for the intergenerational transmission of suboptimal parenting (Main & Goldwyn, 1984). Evidence from research on attachment relationships across the life span suggests that experiences that parents have as children inﬂuence parenting behaviors with their own children. The ﬁnding that attachment classiﬁcations among parents are related to the attachment classiﬁcation of their children is well supported in the research literature \" (p. 172). \n\n\" In a sample of preschool mothers, Putallaz et al. (1991) found that parents could be categorized into three groups in terms of the patterns of their recollections regarding peer relationships. The ﬁrst group recalled generally positive and warm peer relationships, the second group recalled generally negative peer relationships, and the third group recalled having lonely, anxious peer experiences (Putallaz et al., 1991). Interestingly, teacher, peer, and observer ratings of child social competence were highest for children whose mothers reported lonely–anxious peer recollections. Using attachment theory as a conceptual framework to explain this ﬁnding, the authors suggested that the lonely–anxious mothers operated from an internal locus of control. Thus, their parenting practices involved actively building a sense of empowerment and social efﬁcacy in their children (Putallaz et al., 1993). These parents took an active role in shaping their children’s social worlds so as to prevent their children from experiencing the types of peer relationships they experienced in their own childhood. In contrast, it was suggested that mothers who had generally negative peer recollections maintained socially distant relationships as a way to protect themselves from the pain of the social rejection experienced in childhood (Putallaz et al., 1993). The behavior of the mothers in this group would probably reﬂect an attitude that relationships are negative, thus leading to children being socialized in ways that are associated with less social competence. Indeed, children of this group of mothers were perceived as being the least socially competent (Putallaz et al., 1993).\" (p. 173). \n\n\"The accuracy or inaccuracy of parents’ recollections of their school experiences may lead to questions about how early experiences shape later socialization practices. Although actual events and experiences are important, we posit that the nature of the recollection should be the unit of analysis, rather than the accuracy of the recollection per se. As suggested in studies of child abuse (Egeland et al., 1988), accuracy regarding the details of the event may be less inﬂuential than the individual’s feelings and recollections about the event. Similarly, research on adult attachment classiﬁcations is based on adult recollections of experiences from childhood (Main et al., 1985). The way in which events are recalled provides fruitful ground for understanding parental socialization practices\" (p. 174). ",

Parents were also highly likely to talk to their child about college (79.1%) and jobs (79.5%). Just over two-thirds of parents thought that their child could “deﬁnitely” earn a bachelor’s degree.\" (p. 953). ",
   "Findings": "\"Although numerous studies have been conducted to understand the role of parental involvement on a child’s educational outcomes (Fan & Chen, 2001; Hill & Tyson, 2009; Jeynes, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2012), comparatively minimal research has investigated the psychometric properties of the measurement of parental involvement for secondary students. Typically, researchers include one or two items to assess parental involvement in general, or a parental involvement domain, or use assessments developed by individual researchers (Hill & Tyson, 2009; Park & Holloway, 2013; Punter et al., 2016). To better understand the psychometric properties of commonly used parental involvement frameworks with older students, this research proposed to examine the psychometric properties of Hill and Tyson’s (2009) three-domain framework (school-based, home-based, and academic socialization) as well as a more nuanced six-factor model of their framework using a large, national dataset of ninth graders and their parents. One of the unique goals of this study was to include multiple variables to simultaneously assess each of the six subdomains of parental involvement. Encouragingly, the ﬁnal version of the three-factor model had at least seven items assessing the eachofthe three domains andthe six-factor model ranged from two to ﬁve items per subdomain. However, as is often the case, several of the originally included variables did not have adequate psychometric properties to remain in a subscale. Although these excluded variables were noted in the results, it is important to point out that the homework domain included only information about the parents’ conﬁdence in helping with math, science, or English homework. The item about the frequency with which parents helped with homework demonstrated a weak association with the latent factor and was excluded from the ﬁnal models. This is intriguing, given the literature ﬁnding of poor evidence that parental help with homework is related to academic achievement for secondary students.\" (p. 960). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Across the parental involvement variables, parents indicate a range of parental involvement levels with secondary students. Items with the endorsements of 75% or higher were contained in all three of the Hill and Tyson (2009) domains: school-based involvement (attend a school meeting); home-based involvement (doing something on a computer with a child); academic socialization (talk to child about college and talk to child about jobs). Low levels of parental involvement were found across the domains as well, with 26% of parents likely to volunteer at school, 16.4% to attend a science fair, and nearly 50% of parents reported helping their child with homework less than 1 day per week. This ﬁnding of low rates of parental help with homework suggests that homework support works differently withs econdary students compared to elementary students, and that it may not be as useful of domain for older students as it is with younger students. In all, reports of parental involvement were fairly moderate, suggesting that there was a wide variety of types of parental involvement. With regard to the empirical evidence for the ﬁt of models, the single-factor model ﬁt poorly, the three-factor model ﬁt the data better than the single-factor model, but still ﬁt the data relatively poorly, and the six-factor model ﬁt the data acceptably. When looking at the three-factor model, the pattern coefﬁcients ranged from .40 to .75 for schoolbased involvement, .40 to .79 for home-based involvement, and .36 to .96 for academic socialization, indicating fairly low loadings for several variables across the three domains. Factors loadings were similar for the six-factor model with a range of .50–.64 for school–parent communication, .55–.77 for attending school activities, .65–.96 for parent–child communication, .64–.95 for parental aspirations, .49–.63 for educational activities at home, and.64–.93 for homework support. The range of factor loadings was similar for an assessment of parental involvement in early childhood (Bulotsky-Shearer, Bouza, Bichay, Fernandez, & Hernandez, 2016). In all, the factor loadings were fairly strong for most of the six-factor model, with school–parent communication and educational activities at home demonstrating lower loadings. The reasonable factor loadings and the improved goodness of ﬁt for the more speciﬁc conceptualization of parental involvement suggests that future research may beneﬁt from considering the more narrow aspects of parental involvement with high school students, and going beyond the distinction of two or three factors often presented conceptually (e.g., Hill&Tyson,2009;Walkeretal.,2005). Further support for the six-factor model was found when examining correlations among the factors. For example, while the subdomain of home work had its highest correlation with conceptually related activities at home (r=.38), the activities at home subdomain was most highly correlated with school activities(r=.65) and school/parent communication (r = .60). Thus, focusing on broad categories like home-based or school-based involvement might obscure important nuances. This is supported by other researchers that have also examined the role of more narrow subdomains (e.g., Hill&Tyson,2009;Ma,1999;Park&Holloway,2013). Thus, the six-factor conceptualization allows for more nuanced variations among the subdomains that may be helpful when assessing parental involvement with high school students. This research also supports a comprehensive assessment of parental involvement instead of focusing on only a single subdomain. As many of the subdomains are weakly correlated, it would be beneﬁcial for researchers to assess multiple subdomains so as to gain a more comprehensive assessment of parental involvement. If researchers were able to more consistently use a similar six-factor framework for assessing parental involvement, then the ﬁeld could gain more reliable information regarding the roles of speciﬁc subdomains, and how the importance of these domains might change (e.g., age of student, family demographics). Future research into the development of a comprehensive parental involvement in school measure for secondary students, based on the six subdomain framework, would be a valuable addition to the ﬁeld. With regard to school personnel, the ﬁnding that the six subdomain framework performed better than the three or single factor suggests that considering speciﬁc types of parental involvement in school is important to improving student outcomes. Additional research is needed to determine which subdomains of parental involvement are the most predictive of improved outcomes for students and to develop interventions to increase speciﬁc subdomains of parental involvement in school for secondary students.\" (p. 960- 961).

   "Results": "N/A",
   "Findings": "\"Engaging students, teachers, principals, and other stakeholders in the curriculum development cycle resulted in numerous potential revisions representing various, and sometimes irreconcilable, interests (e.g., disagreement between students and teachers on the number of handouts). We reviewed and synthesized the feedback during annual summer work retreats and considered all data sources in conjunction with our strategic planning process framework (AIM) and our theoretical and practical intentions for the WTP (service-learning, youth empowerment, and social justice). Reconciling these varied interests proved challenging and iterative, but through deliberation, we identified revisions and implemented a plan for improving the curriculum prior to the upcoming school year. Our strategies produced curricular revisions that more closely met the varied needs of students, teachers, and schools while maintaining fidelity to our intentions for the curriculum to serve as a vehicle for students to improve their school environments. Because this cycle was repeated annually, subsequent iterations of the curriculum benefited from lessons learned in the year prior. Figure 1.1 illustrates this cycle, in which the university team considered various sources of feedback to deliberate, revise, and deliver a curriculum responsive to the needs and interests of the community.\" (p. 17). \n\n\"Simplification. Arguably the most important revision made to the curriculum because of community feedback was simplification. Site coordinator observations and comments from students, teachers, and staff all pointed to the need to simplify the WTP curriculum. Although WTP teachers participated in three days of training on the curriculum and received technical assistance throughout implementation, the site coordinator noted numerous instances in which teachers did not understand the lesson plan directions. As her observations recounted, “[the WTP teacher] told the kids that this lesson has been confusing to her and she isn’t sure why.” And, at another school, “The students seem confused and not quite sure what to do.… I think this is a lesson we all need to work on.” Also, the teachers and students felt that there was not enough time in the curriculum for students to make the planned changes. For example, one student’s remark that “It seemed like a long process to finally make a change” was echoed by the teacher who commented, “It did feel rushed especially in the end. We spent a lot of time up front and then not as much to get [changes implemented].”\" (p. 18). \n\n\"User-friendliness for teachers. A second thematic revision concerned the need to make the curriculum easier for teachers to deliver. From the outset, we provided teachers with specific and concrete instructions to guide students through the WTP. However, this inadvertently resulted in a highly structured and scripted curriculum (see Appendix A), which impeded some teachers’ abilities to understand, prepare for, and implement WTP lessons. Students noticed their teachers’ over-reliance on these scripted lesson plans. As one student said, “it was kinda, I think, like, boring for her and for us because she kept having to read out of a book.” Another said, “I think that the teacher should be able to teach like they do not follow everything a book says.” Still another student said, “This class would be less boring if … our teacher was allowed to say how she wanted to teach us instead of how the people wanted her to say it.”\" (p. 19). \"As a result of this input from WTP teachers, students, and community members, the curriculum changed from a highly structured and scripted “teacher-proof” (Eryaman & Riedler, 2010) form to a more instructional, teacher-friendly format (Apple, 1988). With fewer scripted portions within the curriculum and more opportunities for teachers to incorporate their own teaching style, the curriculum manual evolved from one of dictation to one more conducive to facilitation of meaningful student experiences (see Appendix B). We also added evaluation rubrics for writing assignments to assist teachers with grading, as well as PowerPoint presentations to guide teacher explanations and activities. These additions, when coupled with strategic eliminations and alterations to lesson plans, produced a curriculum that was easier for teachers to deliver.\" (p. 20). \n\n\"Student engagement. The third thematic curriculum revision involved making activities more engaging for students. Early versions of the WTP curriculum were highly congruent with the AIM process (which is designed for adults), and limited attention was given to the quality of the experiences provided to students. As a result, the WTP failed to maintain students’ attention and excitement on occasions. While early iterations of the curriculum included some engaging activities, such as acting out skits, small group work, decorating journals, creating mural-sized models, and presenting to adults, many lessons prescribed that the teacher explain concepts while students sat passively at their desks and complete individual worksheets to demonstrate understanding. Numerous students critiqued this didactic classroom format.\" (p. 21). ",

   "Study Limitations": "Schools must be willing to engage all people involved in the learning process. \n\n\"Soliciting, synthesizing, and incorporating community feedback is time-consuming, requires a broad range of expertise (e.g., curriculum design, community engagement, and knowledge of school contexts and rural communities), \nand the process itself is fraught with ambiguity, requiring creative problem solving and flexibility.\"  (p. 21-22). ",
   "Notes": "Having a model for community- involved curriculum development may be helpful for other schools to follow. Understanding there must be flexibility according to the different needs of varying communities will have to be taken into account. "

   "Abstract": "\"The current study examined the influence of the placement on academic outcomes in youth receiving out-of-home care. A two-level multilevel model was used to partition variance in youth in care's academic success scores into placement and child-specific levels of influence. Associations between caregiver involvement and academic success in youth in care were also examined. Assessment and Action Record (AAR) data from the Ontario Looking after Children (OnLAC) project were analyzed. The sample included data from 687 youth between 10 and 15 years of age (M age = 12.99 years, SD = 1.68), with slightly more boys (n = 389) than girls (n = 298). While individual differences in academic success were primarily attributable to child-specific effects (85%), 15% of the variance can be attributable to differences between placements. Results also suggested that caregivers who provided more academic support at home and a more positive literacy environment were also more likely to care for youth with higher levels of academic success. Surprisingly, caregiver school-based involvement was not significantly associated with academic achievement in youth in care. Lastly, higher levels of caregiver expectations within the placement and youth's own differential experience were both associated with more academic success. These results suggest that academic outcomes of youth in care may be influenced by the placement in which they live.\"",

",
   "Population": "Foster Families; Students in Other Nations",
   "Extended Population Characteristics": "\"Ontario Looking after Children (OnLAC) data collected through the Assessment and Action Record (AAR) from a large, urban child-welfare agency were analyzed. The AAR tracks and monitors the developmental trajectories of children and adolescence in care (youth in care) across seven developmental domains; health, education, identity, family and social relationships, social presentation, emotional and behavioral development and self-care skills and transition to young adulthood (Flynn, Vincent, & Legault, 2009). Each AAR was completed by child-welfare workers, foster caregivers and youth in care over several sessions. Foster caregivers and youth in care were interviewed together and their responses were recorded by workers. Worker-specific questions were completed by workers privately or during interview sessions. The AAR is completed for each youth on an annual basis.\nThe current sample included cross-sectional data collected in the years 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 (n = 687). For children with longitudinal data, only their earliest OnLAC assessment was included in the sample.

   "Results": "\"Model 1, the null model, partitions variation in children's academic success scores into placement and child-specific levels of influence (refer to Table 2). The placement ICC was .154 (=.154 / (.154 + .845)), indicating that the correlation between youth from the same placement is, on average .154 and that approximately 15% of the variation in youth's scores can be explained by differences between placements. The remaining 85% of variation can be explained by differences between youth themselves. This suggests that relative to child-specific effects, differences between placements appear to be a smaller source of variation in children's academic scores. Although there is a degree of similarity between youth from the same placement, there is a larger degree of dissimilarity.\" (p. 1097). \n\n\"In Model 2, the control variables child age, gender and externalizing behaviors were entered into the model as covariates. Results suggested that younger, relative to older children, displayed higher levels of academic success. For every year of age, there is a .321 standard deviation decrease in children's academic success. Girls, relative to boys showed higher levels of academic success. Lastly, youth with less externalizing behaviors showed higher levels of academic achievement.\" (p. 1097). \n\n\"Caregiver home-based involvement was found to be significantly associated with youth's academic success scores. Specifically, youth from placements that offered more caregiver home-based involvement showed higher levels of academic success relative to those who received less involvement. Moreover, youth from placements with better literacy environments also showed higher levels of achievement. Interestingly, caregiver school-based involvement was not significantly associated with youth's academic success. The inclusion of these variables accounted for approximately 44% of the variance at the placement level.\" (p. 1097). \n\n\"Placements that hold higher academic expectations of all youth were more likely to foster higher achieving youth.

Specifically, the inclusion of these variables accounted for approximately 34% of the variance at the placement level. This suggests that certain placements are more likely to care for youth with certain age, gender and/or externalizing profiles. This speaks to the possibility that not only are more difficult youth being cared for by certain placements, but they are also displaying worst academic outcomes. Although it remains unclear as to whether more difficult youth do worse in school or if doing poorly in school results in higher levels of problematic behaviors, current results nevertheless suggests that these youth in care are particularly vulnerable to academic failure.\" (p. 1098). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Perhaps these patterns of results reflect the possibility that youth in care may benefit more from home-based involvement than caregiver involvement concerning school activities. This notion is supported by existing studies that involve community-based samples where home-based involvement has been found to be a stronger predictor of academic outcomes than school-based involvement (e.g., Izzo et al., 1999). It is possible that within the context of out-of-home care, higher levels of home-based involvement reflect better relationships shared between caregivers and youth. Often, placements characterized by high quality caregiver–youth relationships are more stable and permanent in nature (e.g., Orme & Buehler, 2001). Thus, the feeling of security and support from caregivers may be essential for facilitating higher levels of academic success in youth in care. More importantly, when compared to the support offered through school-based involvement, perhaps support offered through home-based involvement is more responsive to the individual needs of youth in care. Since many youth in care have specialized academic needs (e.g., Stone, 2007), caregivers may be better able to provide the appropriate supports (e.g., tutoring, homework remedies) through home-based involvement.\" (p. 1098). \n\n\"We distinguished between the absolute levels of caregiver expectations from differential expectations experienced by individual youth from the same placement. In support of our original hypothesis, results suggest that both higher levels of absolute and differential expectations, in placements with multiple youth, predicted more academic success.\nAssociations between caregiver expectations and academic achievement in community-based samples are well documented. In fact, when examined over time, the effects of earlier caregiver expectations predicted later academic achievement by operating through children's reading abilities (Davis-Kean, 2005). However, what is novel about current findings is that over and above the effects of caregiver expectations within the same placement, children's differential experiences also predicted higher academic achievement. Although the influence of differential experiences within foster placements on child outcomes have been examined by previous studies (Cheung et al., 2011), this is the first one to examine how absolute and differential experiences with caregiver expectations influence academic outcomes in children, generally.\nA well developed and well researched social phenomenon that may be helpful in understanding the effects of differential expectations is social comparison. Social comparison theory posits that social comparison information is routinely used for a variety of self-regulating functions such as self-enhancement, self-assessment and improvement (Festinger, 1954). Not only are individuals more likely to compare themselves to others who are more similar, but also with those found in their local context (e.g., Wills, 1991). Thus, it is likely that siblings compare themselves across multiple domains, including parental treatment. Indeed, preliminary evidence suggests that comparative processes operate between siblings and that specific parenting towards one child leads to opposite effects on the target child and sibling, a phenomenon coined the ‘sibling barricade’ effect (Feinberg et al., 2000, Reiss et al., 1995). These patterns of results may be attributable to social comparisons between siblings where Sibling 2 is more likely to perceive him/herself as better off when Sibling 1 receives harsher punitive parenting.\" (p. 1098-1099). \n\n\"Given the importance of the placement, the current study also identified three possible processes that can help improve academic outcomes of youth in care: caregiver home-based involvement with school, caregiver academic expectations and literacy environment of the placement. Programs that target these placement-level processes can encourage caregivers to take a more active role in youth's academic experiences by remaining more involved and knowledgeable about school-related activities. This involvement can help caregivers identify difficulties earlier on so that issues and problems can be addressed accordingly. Teaching caregivers effective ways to assist with homework and promoting the literacy environment in the placement are also possible areas of intervention. Perhaps most important is highlighting the importance of caregiver expectations and helping caregivers increase their academic expectations of youth under their care. Although it is important that expectations match ability, helping caregivers recognize the importance of holding higher expectations may be crucial in facilitating better academic outcomes of youth in care.\" (p. 1099).

   "Abstract": "\"Belonging is an essential aspect of psychological functioning. Schools offer unique opportunities to improve belonging for school-aged children. Research on school belonging, however, has been fragmented and diluted by inconsistency in the use of terminology. To resolve some of these inconsistencies, the current study uses meta-analysis of individual and social level factors that influence school belonging. These findings aim to provide guidance on the factors schools should emphasise to best support students. First, a systematic review identified 10 themes that influence school belonging at the student level during adolescence in educational settings (academic motivation, emotional stability, personal characteristics, parent support, peer support, teacher support, gender, race and ethnicity, extracurricular activities and environmental/school safety). Second, the average association between each of these themes and school belonging was meta-analytically examined across 51 studies (N= 67,378). Teacher support and positive personal characteristics were the strongest predictors of school belonging. Results varied by geographic location, with effects generally stronger in rural than in urban locations. The findings may be useful in improving perceptions of school belonging for secondary students through the design of policy, pedagogy and teacher training, by encouraging school leaders and educators to build qualities within the students and change school systems and processes.\"",

The current study endeavoured to overcome some of these criticisms through the use of a clearly defined inclusion criteria and methodology for data extraction and management.\" (p. 27). ",
   "Results": "\"Teacher support (r=0.46 [0.37, 0.54]) had the strongest effect, more so than peer support (r=0.32 [0.2, 0.42]) or parent support (r=0.33 [0.29, 0.36]), and this was followed by personal characteristics (r=0.44 [0.36, 0.52]). For teacher support, the independent variables of autonomy, support and involvement (0.78); caring relationships (0.68); and fairness and friendliness (0.63) offered the strongest effect sizes. Extracurricular activities and race/ethnicity were not significantly related to school belonging, and in the fixed effect analysis, extracurricular activities were found to be associated with less school belonging. Table 3 also reports the fail-safe Ns and more conservative Orwin variant as indicators of the robustness of effects. Effects were robust for parent support, teacher support, emotional stability and personal characteristics, with the Orwin FSN indicating that over 40 null studies would be needed to reduce effects to less than r=0.10. Supplemental Figure S1 illustrates the funnel plots, mapping the Fisher Z for each study against the standard error. There is evidence of bias across the themes, although parent support and personal characteristics were the least biased amongst the 10 themes.\" (p. 12- 18). \n\n\"As indicated in Table 3, there was considerable heterogeneity for each theme, suggesting that the average effects may be impacted by research study characteristics.

Significant differences were found between geographical regions in all of the themes except gender. To explore this moderating effect further, Table 5 breaks down the effect sizes (based on a random effects model)for each location (alsoillustrated inSupplemental FigureS2).Rural locations tended to have stronger effect sizes (r=0.51), whereas urban locations tended to be smaller (r=0.25). Similarly, for teacher support, the correlation in rural locations was 0.55 and in urban location, 0.31. The exception was emotional stability; the effect was strong for mixed locations (r= 0.49), whereas effects were similar in rural (r=0.18) and urban (r=0.21) locations.\" (p. 18- 20). ",
   "Findings": "\"Across 51 studies and over 67,000 participants, all but race/ethnicity and extracurricular activities were significantly related to school belonging, with the largest effects for teacher support and personal characteristics.

However, this was dependent on geographic location; academic motivation was strongly related to school belonging in rural and suburban schools, with much weaker correlations in urban settings. Although schools often focus on academic achievementandperformance,by targeting the learningprocessrather than performance itself, students may benefit from both better performance and a greater sense of school belonging\" (p. 24). \n\n\"One of the themes that was most strongly associated with school belonging was positive personal characteristics, such as conscientiousness, optimism and self-esteem. Literature in both personality and positive psychology disciplines have identified positive characteristics as correlates of good social relationships. Almost all of the studies showed moderate to high correlations with school belonging. The weakest correlates, though still moderate in size, were self-esteem and social self-efficacy.\" (p. 24). \n\n\"Contrary to expectations, peer support, while influential towards school belonging, made less of a contribution to school belonging when compared with parent support or teacher support. Such a finding is contrary to others suggesting that peers are the strongest influence on daily behaviour at school (Steinberg 2001), but are consistent with studies that suggest that the quality of relationships matter. It may be the type of peers who determine attitudes and feelings towards school, rather than just the presence or absence of peers (Galliher et al. 2004; Gering2009).Studies that measured caring relationships, having friends at school and positive perceptions of relationships demonstrated moderate to strong associations with school belonging, whereas associations were mixed for acceptance and perceived social support, ranging from r=0.07 to r=0.54.\" (p. 25). \n",
   "Findings cont": "\"\"In line with other research (Hattie 2009), the strongest factor impacting school belonging was teacher support. Students who believe that they have positive relationships with their teachers and that their teachers are caring, empathic and fair and help resolve personal problems, are more likely to feel a greater sense of belonging than those students who perceive a negative relationship with their teachers. Negative interactions with parents or peers can even be intervened by teachers, and while the family may be the first unit to which children belong, students often spend more time at school \" (p. 25).\n\n\"Only five studies included measures of extracurricular activities. Effects were non-significant, small (r=−0.09) and negative in the fixed effect model. Several studies suggested a positive correlation between extracurricular activities and a sense of school belonging (Blomfield and Barber 2010; Waters et al.2010); however, there may be an optimal number of extracurricular activities a student should be involved in\" (p. 25- 26).\n\n\"The one factor that did matter was geographic location. Effects generally were stronger in rural and suburban areas than in urban and mixed areas, particularly for academic motivation, personal characteristics and teacher support. This finding may relate to the smaller class sizes, less disciplinary problems, greater participation in extra-curricular activities and more time for individual student-teacher interactions in rural schools than schools in urban settings (Freeman and Anderman 2005; Knoblauch and Woolfolk-Hoy 2008). It is also possible that urban schools are more heterogeneous, including both high socio-economic private schools as well as low-income, at-risk schools\" (p. 26). ",

Similarly, if one is motivated and engaged at school and receives good results, one may equally have positive feelings about the school.

   "Findings": "\"When transferring from one home placement to another during the school year, many foster children are not immediately enrolled in their new school.

This results in the child continuing to be marked absent and ending up with failing grades for classes taken. For foster youths who have individualized education programs (IEPs), there often are procedural problems around placement in the most appropriate program and the provision of special education services to which they are entitled. For many high school foster youths, the frequent mid-semester moves mean they do not receive credit for classes in which they have been enrolled. When admitted to the new school, the academic classes they need are already full. They often are placed in any class with an opening and sometimes fewer classes than required for a full schedule. The cumulative effect is that they have not taken the required courses for high school graduation or entrance to a four-year college or university. Another serious problem is that children who must transfer from school to school cannot get involved in school activities or make lasting friendships. \" (p. 168). \n\nJoining certain sports teams require a minimum GPA to be held, and if students are falling behaind due to issues outside of their control, they may not be able to participate in the extracurricular activities that they would like. \n\nSome foster children are medicated heavily for symptoms arising from difficult life transitions. \n\n\"The private special education schools (called nonpublic schools or NPSs), often on-site schools associated with the group homes, were problematic because of low level academics, difficulty accumulating credits, mixed age grouping with students ranging from 11 to 17 in the same classroom, not fully credentialed teachers, no extracurricular activities, and no physical education. Also unavailable at these schools were college counseling and high school courses like algebra and advanced placement classes. \" (p. 168- 169). \n\n\"There also is a problem of overidentification and underidentification of foster youths for special education services. Because of frequent school transfers, some school districts fail to identify and make eligible for special education services foster youths who have learning disabilities or emotional disturbances. For example, some schools repeatedly suspend foster youths for oppositional behaviors when these young people would be better served in special education receiving counseling for an emotional disturbance. Other districts, because of the lack of educational supports in general education, overidentify for special education foster youths who are at risk for school failure to obtain more intensive services. Along the same lines, too often a foster youth is identified as being eligible for special education to facilitate placement in a group home that requires concurrent enrollment in the on-site private special education school (even if the youth does not require this restrictive a school placement). Those who truly need special education services frequently have poorly written IEPs that do not necessarily address their needs.\" (p. 169). \n\n\"Keeping track of school records is a major problem for children in foster care. Problems with transfer of school records cause delays in enrollment in school, lack of credits for graduation, repetition of classes because there is no record of requirements having been met, failure to identify special education eligibility, and inappropriate placements. One youth said, “There was a class that I took three times at three different schools and completed, that is still not on my transcripts” (former foster youth). Because of the many school transfers, it is very difficult to locate the school records for large numbers of foster children. Not only are full or partial records lost over the years, but also no one, including the child, can recall all the schools the child has attended. There is also a lack of a consistent system for collecting and tracking records. The one statewide information database for child welfare (Child Welfare System/Case Management System; CWS/ CMS) is very limited in the kind of educational information that it was mandated to record. Any update to the system must receive federal approval. The databases being developed in each county are unique to each county, which complicates matters\nwhen children are placed outside of the county or moved from county to county. There is a new California regulation requiring foster children to have medical and education passports that move with them when they change placements. However, not all counties have implemented the requirement and few foster youths actually have these passports\" (p. 169- 170). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"No one has specific responsibility for ensuring that students are checked out of school when they are moved to a different home so that they do not receive failing grades in classes they have been taking, immediately enrolled in school once they are placed in the new home, attending school on a regular basis, and enrolled in schools that teach core academic subjects that meet California’s curriculum standards. Moreover, there is much confusion over who holds education rights. The court may or may not limit the biological parents’ education rights, and the schools and social workers may or may not be informed about who holds education rights. This becomes problematic when the school needs a parent’s signature to assess the student or make changes in placement or services. Without someone monitoring that foster youths are learning and progressing satisfactorily in school, some youths in the foster care system turn 18 with very limited reading and math skills. As one participant said, “The issue I have is when my client turns 18 and they can’t read…it doesn’t matter how many credits they have!” (judicial officer). Others turn 18 without enough high school credits to graduate and are “aged out” of the foster care sys\ntem and forced to find another place to live (which typically means they leave school and do not get a high school diploma.)\" (p. 170). \n\n\"The new state and federal accountability measures have created a new set of problems for foster youths. Because schools are required to show that their students are meeting high academic standards and are subject to sanctions if students do not show progress, school administrators are less inclined to want children in foster care to attend, believing that the foster children will lower the school’s overall achievement scores.\" (p. 170). \n\n\" Discussing the merits of collaboration and coordination seems to be much easier than actually doing it. The education and social services agencies are seen as bureaucratic and dysfunctional. As one participant put it: “There is no system; not even six different systems; there are six dysfunctional bureaucracies that try to work together sometimes if the people know each other” (caregiver/provider). Furthermore, there is no statewide standard on how to coordinate services, and as a result there is a wide variety of methods being used around the state. Local and state education agencies are infrequently at the table when discussions about services for foster youths are held. The education system is viewed as too complicated to understand by other agencies, especially child welfare agencies, and therefore it is considered easier to simply ignore school issues. On the other hand, educators feel lost when dealing with the child welfare system. It is also difficult to identify the education decision makers. Although there are 58 counties in the state, there are 80 school districts with elected school boards in Los Angeles County alone. Collaboration at the local level is not the only problem. There seems to be a sense that it is more difficult for state agencies to coordinate their activities than it is for local agencies.\" (p. 171). \n\n\"As a result of these cumulative privacy and confidentiality protections, access to specific information is more limited than if the informant were maintained by a single agency. These confidentiality requirements are often criticized because they lead to inconsistent results when agencies try to work together on behalf of a single child or family.  Nonetheless, the issues of confidentiality can interfere with advocating for a child’s education because the schools are reluctant to share information with the child welfare agency and courtappointed special advocates cannot give information regarding the child to the school\" (p. 171). \n\n\"• maintenance of foster youths in their schools of origin through provisions in the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act or California’s new AB490 legislation. This will require ensuring that transportation funds are set aside by the state or local school districts to cover transportation costs so that children living in foster placements outside their home districts can remain in their schools of origin, if appropriate.\n • designation of educational liaisons to advocate for the educational needs of children in foster care; ensure timely enrollment in and check-out of school; maintain and transfer school records; and ensure appropriateness of school programs. \n• inclusion of educators as members of initial intake teams for all foster youths. Educators would be responsible for examining available education records and providing assessment in areas in which no information exists. \n• required attendance at preschool or other early childhood education programs for three and four-year-old foster children. • careful monitoring of medication of foster youths with mental health problems to evaluate how medication affects learning. \n• extension of federal and state funds to cover youths in foster care beyond their 19th birthday if they have not graduated from high school. \n• careful placement of foster youths in private special education schools with respect to appropriateness of program and monitoring for quality of schooling and accumulation of credits.\n • expansion of statewide information data system (that is, CWS/CMS) to include more educational data and access for school personnel. Data collection should include educational information necessary for monitoring the education of foster youths (that is, attendance, retention, IEPs, achievement test scores, dropout rates)\n • ensuring consistency across recordkeeping databases being developed by individual counties as well as ability to share data across counties.\" (p. 172).

   "Abstract": "\"Children in the foster care system often face many educational challenges, including having an increased risk of language delays compared to the general population, with an estimated 35%–73% of the foster youth population experiencing language difficulties. Language delays are caused by many factors, but for children in foster care, one major antecedent is child abuse and neglect. Early delays greatly impact long-term outcomes for children, including delays in their reading, writing, and social competence. This article explores possible causes of language delays for youths in foster care, describes the negative impact of language delays, and identifies evidence-based practices for early intervention within the child welfare system and primary and secondary schools, specifically targeting practices for school psychologists, school counselors, school social workers, and speech pathologists.\"",

   "Results": "\"Preschool programs such as Head Start and Early Head Start are one example of appropriate support for youths in foster care with language delays. Head Start and Early Head Start serve many children (birth to 5) in communities throughout the United States but have priority enrollment for children in the foster care system and children with disabilities (Neighborhood Housing Association Head Start Program, 2017). The programs are federally funded and provide early childhood education, development programs, and family support. One study indicated that children enrolled in a specific curriculum of Head Start (Head Start Research Based Developmentally Informed) improved significantly in both social-emotional and language/literacy skills after 1 year of enrollment over children in traditional Head Start programs (Bierman et al., 2008). This indicates that it may be important for advocates of youths in foster care to look at the curriculum that is being used in their local Head Start and to advocate for a curriculum that specifically targets language and social-emotional needs. Although research has shown that Head Start is an effective intervention for youths in foster care, there is currently a lack of emphasis on collaboration between the child welfare and early childhood education systems (Merrit& Klein, 2015; Phillips & Meloy, 2012). Therefore, not all children in foster care who have language delays have access to preschool programs such as HeadStart. Further research and advocacy on the effectiveness of this intervention for children in foster care with language delays should be conducted and disseminated within the child welfare field to increase access and improve long-term outcomes.\" (p. 529). ",
   "Findings": "\"There are in-home programs that can be used to increase the rate of language development for youths in foster care with language delays. One program, Language for Learning, employed a strategy of 20, 1-hour intervention sessions within the homes of 4-year-old children with language delays (Wake et al., 2012). Although these children were not specifically youths in foster care, they found that the intervention significantly increased language outcomes for these children at 5 and 6 years old and that it was a cost-effective intervention that could be employed by a variety of professionals within different communities.\" (p. 529). \n\n\"Regarding interventions, children that are experiencing language delays as a result of maltreatment are a different population than students who are identified with language delays caused by other factors. Therefore, these students may require a combination of traditional types of language-based interventions and interventions that help address the specific needs of youths in foster care. One form of intervention specific to helping youths in foster care could be the school psychologist providing trauma-informed care professional development for staff working with youths in foster care. Trauma-informed care is a lens for viewing student behavior that can fulfill the need for feelings of safety for youths in foster care and increase language usage (Beyerlein & Bloch, 2014). Through helping students to increase feelings of safety, form connections, and regulate their emotions, students can begin to learn appropriate language skills that they would not be able to learn when they feel unsafe, disconnected, and alone\" (p. 530). \n\n\"A final form of intervention could be the school psychologist providing small group or individual counseling for students with language delays who have social emotional difficulties (i.e., difficulty managing and understanding emotions). A wide variety of programs ranging from the whole school to small group and individual interventions that address social-emotional needs can be found through the Collaborative for Academic, Social and Emotional Learning (CASEL, 2017). CASEL is made up of a network of collaborators whose mission is to make evidence-based social and emotional learning an essential part of K-12 education. \" (p. 531). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Empowering youths in the foster care system to be resilient using innovative and evidence-based strategies has been a focus in recent years. One example is a course created by Michael Place, a former youth in care and now an educator and advocate. Place (2017) developed an online course called Fostering Resilience in Children and Young Adults designed for children in care and or youth-serving organizations. The course focuses on (1) building resilience in youths who experience trauma, (2) identifying and fostering resilient behaviors in these youths, and (3) creating a Resilient Action Plan. School professionals can work as a team to encourage and consider similar opportunities for youths in care. Second, through team discussions, school professionals can come to understand the student from multiple viewpoints and provide resources that each person may not have available on their own. This often happens within a multidisciplinary team approach. Multidisciplinary teams are made up of a group of professionals from different disciplines, family members, and other stakeholders who work together toward a common goal (Mental Health Commission,2006). In this case, the common goal would be to improve outcomes for youths in care with language delays. Each professional on the team could provide discipline-specific resources and share these resources with the team. This helps to eradicate the old practice of working in silos and embraces a cross-disciplinary approach to evidence-based practices that meet the complex and unique needs of this population. Multidisciplinary approaches have been highly effective when working with youths in care as they allow teams to collaborate, advocate, address challenges, and develop stronger connections (Abbott, Watson, & Townsley, 2005; Hochstadt & Harwicke, 1985; Rosenwald & Riley, 2010). Next, as a team, they can reach out to the community, and work toward educating parents of young children about the importance of early linguistic experiences, such as the importance of talking to their infant and having books within the home. This early linguistic experience can be accomplished through Family Literacy Programs as described within the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007. The literacy programs integrate (1) interactive literacy activities between parent and child (PACT Time),(2)training on how to be the primary teacher for their child and fulltime involved partner in their education, (3) parent literacy training that fosters future economic self-sufficiency, and (4) age-appropriate education to prepare children for success in school and life experiences (Gadsden-Dupree, 2014; Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act,2007)\" (p. 532- 533).

   "Abstract": "\"Our actions can be triggered by intentions, incentives or intrinsic values. Recent neuroscientiﬁc research has yielded some results about the growth mindset and intrinsic motivation. With the advances in neuroscience and motivational studies, there is a global need to utilize this information to inform educational practice and research. Yet, little is known about the neuroscientiﬁc interplay between growth mindset and intrinsic motivation. This paper attempts to draw on the theories of growth mindset and intrinsic motivation, together with contemporary ideas in neuroscience, outline the potential for neuroscientiﬁc research in education. It aims to shed light on the relationship between growth mindset and intrinsic motivation in terms of supporting a growth mindset to facilitate intrinsic motivation through neural responses. Recent empirical research from the educational neuroscience perspective that provides insights into the interplay between growth mindset and intrinsic motivation will also be discussed.\"",

   "Theoretical Basis": "\" Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence can be nurtured through learning and effort, while intrinsic motivation is the volition to engage in a task for inherent satisfaction. Individuals with growth mindset believe that motivation can be nurtured, and that extrinsic motivation can be internalized (i.e., from extrinsic regulation to integrated regulation that is similar to intrinsically motivated behavior).\" (p. 2). ",
   "Description": "\"The use of neuroscientiﬁc techniques enables us to focus on the learning process rather than the learning outcomes [29]. The neuroimaging ﬁndings offer an understanding of the brain, indicating the speciﬁc areas of brain activation which could in turn correlate with the behavioral results. \" (p. 4)\n\nMethods include EEG and fMRI",
   "Assessment": "N/A",
   "Results": "\"The study by Moser et al. [30] suggested that individuals with a growth mindset are receptive to corrective feedback, exhibiting a higher Pe (error positivity) waveform response, which is correlated with a heightened awareness of and attention to mistakes. Enhanced Pe amplitude was associated with enhanced attention to corrective feed back following errors and subsequent error correction. Individuals with growth mindset are likely to have heightened awareness of and attention to errors. In addition, growth-minded individuals may neutralize the affective response to negative feedback, which could be indicated by neural activation. Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is the region of frontal midline cortex that is related to learning and control [31]. A recent study [32] found that growth mindset was related to both ventral and dorsal striatal connectivity with dorsal ACC. Dorsal ACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are critical to error-monitoring and behavioral adaptation. Growth mindset was strongly associated with dorsal and ventral striatal connectivity, as well as DLPFC. Learners with growth mindset are efﬁcient in error-monitoring and receptive to corrective feedback. Hence, growth mindset has the potential to encourage intrinsically motivated behaviors in schools and promote lifelong learning.\" (p. 4). \n\n\"Neuroscientiﬁc evidence has shown that ACC is associated to cognitive control and motivation [31]. Neural correlates revealed that dopamine is critical for motivation and cognitive control,with motivation-cognition interactions between midbrain regions and lateral frontal cortex [33]. Cognitive control is inﬂuenced by reward motivation. Participants were assigned to three levels of cognitive controls (low, mid and high). Different beneﬁcial effects of reward (high versus low) were exhibited. Participants with high versus low reward anticipation showed increased activity in the medial and lateral frontal cortex. Brain activity was also stronger at the low level of cognitive control than mid and high levels. These ﬁndings demonstrated that motivation plays an important role in the cognitive control. In addition, high-level control tasks may demand an enhancing effect of motivation.\" (p. 4).\n\n\"Little is known about the interplay between neural responses and intrinsic motivation. Intrinsically motivated action can be characterized by an individual’s engagement in behavior for one’s own sake, with free-choice time on a task [36]. An empirical study measured intrinsic motivation by examining a network of brain regions as the participants spent free-choice time on a word problem task [37]. Using fMRI, a network of brain regions revealed diminished task-related activity, predicting subsequent increased intrinsic motivation. The neuroimaging data suggest that decreased activation of neural cognitive control is associated with increased intrinsic motivation, thus extending one’s task engagement. Another recent study by Lee and Reeve [38] examined the neural substrates of intrinsic motivation during task performance. Their ﬁndings showed activated anterior insular cortex (AIC; a limbic-related cortex region) when students performed intrinsically motivated tasks. These neural ﬁndings are consistent with the concept of intrinsic motivation in terms of pursuit and interest satisfaction as intrinsic rewards. Based on these ﬁndings, it was concluded that AIC activity and its functional interactions are linked to an intrinsic-motivation neural system\" (p. 4). ",
   "Findings": "\"Dopamine is considered a key substrate of intrinsic motivation, thus promoting attentiveness and behavioral engagement [25]. For instance, participants were likely to voluntarily engage with the task during a free-choice time period [26] or a self-determined choice condition [27]. These consistent ﬁndings indicate that an enhanced activity within the dopaminergic value system whereby perceived autonomy support promotes intrinsic motivation. As such, learning is a neural process that requires the reinforcement of synaptic functioning and is strongly mediated by dopamine and attentional gain in the frontal cortex [28]. Positive and negative affect will also strengthen or weaken the learner’s intrinsic motivation in a particular subject, thus inﬂuencing the attitude towards that subject.\" (p. 3). \n\n\"Intrinsic motivation is associated with sensitivity of feedback processing in the striatum [41]. The striatum plays a key role in reinforcing learning as it receives input from midbrain dopamine neurons and produces adaptive behaviors. Striatum activity is associated with reward processing, indicating that an intrinsically motivated task could foster the individual’s intrinsic motivation. For instance, feedback-related responses in the striatum can potentially promote or undermine intrinsic motivation of a desired behavior. Positive feedback was viewed as a rewarding outcome, and highly motivated subjects could attune to the feedback despite of fatigue through the study [41]. Performance-feedback may have affective salient response to striatum and produce a motivated behavior. A study by Lee [42] showed that intrinsic motivation was related to the AIC that is known to be associated with the sense of agency, while extrinsic motivation was associated with posterior parietal regions (e.g., posterior cingulate cortex, angular gyrus). The type of task also plays a very important role in activating the AIC. Lee [42] also found that interesting tasks activated the AIC and ventral striatum (i.e., brain region for reward processing), but not uninteresting tasks. AIC relates to the satisfaction of intrinsic need, whereas ventral striatum relates to the feeling of reward. His ﬁndings suggest that AIC and ventral striatum activations are associated with intrinsic motivation.\" (p. 5-6). \n\n\"Compared to the EEG, which is based on brain waveforms, fMRI is a better method for showing insights into the brain regions that are associated with growth mindset and intrinsic motivation. It is interesting to note that growth mindset is mainly associated with the dorsal regions of the brain, whereas intrinsic motivation is associated with the mid-brain regions. The common brain areas that are related to both growth mindset and intrinsic motivation are ACC and ventral striatum. Knowing the behavioral correlates for these two brain regions, potential research could investigate the neural correlates of growth mindset and intrinsic motivation. This brings us a step closer to understand the neural mechanism between growth mindset and intrinsic motivation.\" (p. 6). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"For successful intervention studies, there are some considerations that need to be warranted. First, educators should design a task that has intrinsic value for students to be engaged in doing. For instance, an interesting task will instill curiosity into students, when compared to an uninteresting one. Inculcating the value of doing the task or task value will deﬁnitely stimulate the students’ interest. Second, teachers should provide the autonomy or choice for students. Autonomy or the agency of learning is the key substrate to intrinsic motivation [17]. Research has shown that autonomy is the strongest predictor of intrinsic motivation [47]. Autonomy is considered the self-endorsement of actions, whereby individuals feel less coerced and they generate autonomous behavior at work or school. In the same vein, choice is the opportunity for individuals to decide and exert control over the situation. A recent study found that the provision of choice, however trivial or inconsequential, might also increase an individual’s intrinsic motivation [48]. The researchers used behavioral and electrophysiological (i.e.,electroencephalogram) evidence to explain the importance of need satisfaction for autonomy to enhance one’s intrinsic motivation toward the task.\" (p. 7). \n\n\"Third and ﬁnally, performance-related feedback could inﬂuence intrinsic motivation [41]. Participants are likely to perceive their performance on the task differently based on the type of performance-related feedback. For instance, positive feedback may enhance one’s intrinsic motivation, while negative feedback may undermine one’s motivation. In addition, the frequency of performance-related feedback may affect one’s neural processing (i.e., posterior cingulate cortex) in supporting task performance. There were enhanced activity of posterior cingulate cortex and performance gains after the performance-feedback manipulation. This shows that posterior cingulate cortex might facilitate the learning of a task [41]. The current level of a learner’s intrinsic motivation may also inﬂuence the way he or she processes the performance-related feedback. It is still not fully clear how the nature of performance-feedback could affect an individual’s feedback processing. Perhaps neuroscience methods could provide some insights into this area of research.\" (p. 7). ",

   "Description": "\"1. Intervention activities should address both written language awareness and phonological awareness.\"\n2. Intervention activities should include naturalistic, embedded opportunities for knowledge attainment as well as explicit exposure to key concepts (i.e., an “explicit- embedded balance”). Emphasizing an explicit-embedded balance means engaging children throughout the day in child-centered, contextualized, meaningful literacy activities but also providing regular, structured opportunities for teacher-directed, explicit exposure to key literacy concepts. Any emergent literacy intervention should occur in highly contextualized, meaningful, and familiar environments; activities should emphasize the use of naturally occurring artifacts and interactions in which adults are highly responsive to children’s interests and activities (Kaderavek & Justice, 2002; Watkins & Bunce, 1996). Early childhood emergent literacy interventions should be designed to promote frequent quality interactions with oral and written language at school and at home. Promoting children’s skills and knowledge in nonfunctional and contrived contexts in which children are only passively engaged is inconsistent with the knowledge base concerning how children acquire literacy knowledge. Nevertheless, some children require explicit, repeated, and intensive guidance to develop emergent literacy knowledge. This can be efficiently and effectively accomplished by children’s participation in teacher-led activities that focus the children’s attention on the forms and functions of orthography and phonology.\n3.Practices should be evidence-based. To ensure that the interventions delivered to young children effectively and efficiently increase emergent literacy knowledge, early childhood educators should rely on evidence-based practices—the use of intervention strategies and procedures that have been rigorously studied to demonstrate efficacy or effectiveness with a specific or generalized population.\" (p. 101). ",
   "Assessment": "\"For each of the three promising evidence-based interventions described here there is adequate evidence in the literature showing their probable efficacy or demonstrated effectiveness for encouraging emergent literacy in young children. \" (p. 103). ",
   "Results": "See tables in article",
   "Findings": "\"Adult–child shared storybook reading has featured prominently in a number of recent studies investigating effective strategies for promoting oral language and emergent literacy in young children at risk. A continually growing body of work has confirmed that shared storybook reading provides a potent context in which emergent literacy growth can be facilitated. Educators and parents have therefore been encouraged to increase the frequency with which young children in their care participate in shared storybook reading interactions (e.g., Snow et al., 1998). Just providing children with increased access to storybooks results in substantial gains in emergent literacy, including alphabet knowledge and print concepts (Neuman, 1999).\" (p. 103). \n\nAdults can use these evidence- based strategies when reading with their children: Dialogic reading and print referencing. \nDialogic reading: \"When reading books with children, adults integrate a set of behaviors into their reading interactions: (a) asking open-ended questions and limiting use of yes/no (close-ended) questions; (b) following children’s answers with additional questions; (c) repeating and expanding on what children say; (d) offering praise, encouragement, and feedback for children’s participation; and (e) following children’s interests. These behaviors are designed to increase children’s engagement and active participation—that is, to create a dialogue—and to provide adult models of language targets.\" (p. 107). \n\nPrint referencing: \"A second bookreading strategy that can be used to encourage emergent literacy. Like dialogic reading, print referencing makes use of the adult–child shared storybook reading context in a way that maximizes children’s learning opportunities. With print referencing, the adult incorporates verbal and nonverbal references to print into the book-reading routine to encourage a child’s explicit and implicit interactions with and attention to oral and written language. Verbal behaviors include questions about print (e.g., “Where should I start reading on this page?”), comments about print (e.g., “We know this letter—it’s an A!”), and requests concerning print (e.g., “Point to the dog’s words”). Nonverbal behaviors include pointing to print and tracking the print when reading (see Table 4). In using these strategies, the adult provides explicit guidance to encourage the child’s exposure to key emergent literacy concepts within the context of a highly contextualized, familiar, and meaningful event. Several studies have shown print referencing to be a promising intervention with probable efficacy for encouraging emergent literacy development in typically developing and at-risk preschoolers (e.g., Ezell et al., 2000; Justice & Ezell, 2000, 2002). Studies have shown that adult use of print referencing over relatively brief periods resulted in substantial increases in children’s print awareness, word concepts, and alphabet knowledge.\" (p. 107- 108). \n",
   "Findings cont": "\"Similar to intervention approaches involving shared storybook reading, literacy-enriched play settings capitalize upon the use of an activity that is highly contextualized, meaningful, and familiar to the preschool child. Naturalistic, hypothesis-generating observations of young children’s dramatic play have shown children’s use of literacy artifacts during play to occur fairly frequently (e.g., Schrader, 1990). For instance, children who are playing at being a mother and a child might embed literacy artifacts (e.g., shopping lists, newspapers, magazines) into these routines to reflect a broad schematic and cultural context. A number of experts have asserted that children’s use of such artifacts and routines both reflects and mediates their growing knowledge concerning literacy\" (p. 108). \n\n\"The general design of play-based interventions involves the deliberate integration of literacy props and materials into children’s dramatic play settings in the classroom (see Table 5). Studies have shown significant increases in children’s literacy-related play when literacy props are integrated into play centers, particularly when adult mediation is involved. The term adult mediation refers to adult scaffolding of children’s interactions with literacy props during play through modeling, role playing, or conversation.\" (p. 109). \n\n\"Phonological awareness is a particularly important aspect of emergent literacy. Lack of awareness of the implicit, structural, and sublexical aspects of spoken language prevents children from (a) making sense of the alphabetic principle and (b) benefiting from formal reading instruction (Uhry & Shepherd, 1997). Although many children intuitively begin to experiment with the phonological structure of oral language during the preschool years, as occurs in rhyming games, a small percentage of children have considerable and ongoing difficulties with this particular aspect of literacy growth (Torgesen et al., 1994; Wagner & Torgesen, 1987). To promote the achievement of an early foundation in phonological awareness and to possibly circumvent later problems in this area, explicit PA instruction through use of a structured curriculum is increasingly prevalent in the preschool and kindergarten classroom.\" (p. 109). \nVarious curricula designed to target phonological awareness include: \nLadders to literacy (Notan-Syverson et al., 1998; O'Connor et al., 1998b)\nPhonemic Awareness in Young Children (Adams, Foorman, Lundberg, & Beller, 1998).\nRoad to the Code: A program of Early Literacy Activities to Develop Phonological Awareness (Blachman, Ball, Black, & Tangel, 2000).\nSound Foundations (Byrne & Fielding-Barnsley, 1991b). ",
   "Study Limitations": "Some of the programs in the phonological awareness category may have been revised and thus need further study, and/ or new programs possibly have been developed since then. ",

   "Theoretical Basis": "\"Shannon (1997) conducted a study on student-led conferences and found that they caused students to accept greater personal responsibility for learning and enhanced the students' ability to share personal achievements and accomplishments with teachers and parents. Lenski, Riss, and Flickinger (1996) concluded that students were empowered through student-led parent conferences because the conferences provided a forum in which to share and discuss their strengths, weaknesses, progress, and academic and social goals. These findings are consistent with the positive results realized at L'Ouverture Elementary, an inner-city computer magnet school in Wichita, Kansas, that has received several awards for successfully motivating and engaging students in learning.\" (p. 333). ",
   "Description": "\"Hackmann (1997) and Le Countryman and Schroeder (1996) suggested that student-led conferences consist of three phases: (1) preconference preparation, (2) conference, and (3) postconference evaluation. Gustine teachers adopted a six-stage process to encourage wider acceptance and implementation of the concept by teachers in grades 6 and 8. The six-stage process also became a guide for helping students develop portfolios of their work and conduct successful conferences. Many of the ideas incorporated into each stage were adapted from a handbook on student-led conferences developed by Miller (1995). The teachers collaboratively determined the contents and organization of the student portfolios and developed procedures for implementation of student-led parent-teacher conferences. \" (p. 335). ",
   "Assessment": "N/A",
   "Results": "N/A",
   "Findings": "\"Stage 1\nGustine teachers chose to have students use three-ring binders to store their completed work and written reflections. The binders consist of eight sections: introduction, English, history, mathematics, science, physical education, exploration, and quarter grades. The introductory section of each binder includes a letter that introduces the student, an autobiographical poem, and a summary of personal reflections. All of the core subject sections begin with a self-reflection on academic gains that the student has made since the end of the last grading period. In addition, each student lists strengths and weaknesses in that subject and provides a brief description of citizenship behavior for the given grading period. The student also sets goals for the next grading period. Each core subject section contains four pieces of work, two selected by the teacher and two selected by the student.\n\nStage 2\nThe second stage involves preparation of the portfolios. The students write the introductory letters and autobiographical poems in their English classes. Students use a form developed by Miller (1995) and modified by the Gustine teachers to guide them through the self-reflection process for each core subject.\n\nA letter informing parents of upcoming student-led parent-teacher conferences is sent home with each student. The letter explains to parents that their child will be leading the regularly scheduled spring parent conference by sharing a portfolio of his or her work and progress since the end of the last grading period. The letter further informs parents that teachers will be available to answer questions regarding their child's portfolio and other academic performance and progress issues. The parent letter includes the conference dates and a return slip for requesting a specific day and time.\n\nStage 3\nThe teachers refer to stage 3 as \"portfolio organization day.\" Students pick up their portfolio binders in their first-period classes and use time in each class of the day to complete a reflection page and insert four samples of work for that subject. All of the selected work comes from completed assignments that teachers or students have opted to save since the end of the last grading period. Those materials are typically saved in individual student files in each classroom. At the end of the day, the students return their portfolios to the classrooms where they are stored. \n\n Stage 4\nTraining is the fourth stage. The teachers at each grade level share storage and training responsibilities on a rotational basis. In 2000, those responsibilities were assigned to the science teachers, who conducted training over a three-day period. Students learned how to lead a conference and practiced the procedure during their regular science classes. On the first day of training, the teacher trainers model conference procedures and activities. The agenda for the first day of training includes the following:\n\n    Procedures for walking into the conference room and taking the portfolio with the correct student identification sticker\n    Protocol for greeting conference participants (i.e., welcoming parents and other student guests at the door, shaking their hands, and thanking them for coming to the student-led parent-teacher conferences)\n    Information on the room setup for conferencing and the procedure for seating parents and other guests\n    Advice on explaining the purpose of the conference to parents\n    Tips on presenting and explaining portfolios; the teacher trainers suggest that the students provide a brief summary of their accomplishments and reflections, address areas where improvement is needed, share descriptions and explanations as to why certain assignments were selected for inclusion in the portfolios, and allow time for parents to make comments and ask questions\n    Conference closure; for instance, students are advised to reiterate their academic and social goals, ask parents if they have any additional questions, including those they wish to direct to the teachers, and thank parents and other adult guests for attending their conferences \n\nOn day 2 of training, students pair up and practice the conference format with their peers. One student presents while the other actively listens and provides feedback. After fifteen minutes, each pair exchanges roles. Day 3 of training is very exciting for students. On this day members of the community (school board members and city officials) are invited to sit in the place of parents as students present their portfolios. Community members are asked by teachers beforehand to provide positive feedback and words of encouragement\" (p. 334-335). ",
   "Findings cont": "\" Stage 5\n\nStage 5 is the actual conference night. The teachers post their schedules outside the classrooms where the conferences are conducted. The schedule for each grade level allows for five fifteen-minute conferences to occur simultaneously. The room for each grade is arranged so one conference can take place in each corner, with the fifth taking place in the center. The conference areas are spread out to ensure privacy and to allow teachers to circulate, interject themselves as needed, and answer questions for parents.\n\nStage 6\nAfter each conference, teachers thank parents for coming and invite each to write a letter to his or her child that shares personal feelings and opinions about the conference and/or the child's recent performance and goals for the next reporting period. Stage 6 is dedicated to reviewing and analyzing the parent letters.\n\nAfter the spring 2000 conferences, parents, teachers, and students were surveyed about their perceptions of the student-led parent-teacher conference concept. Parent comments were very positive about the concept overall. The following generalizations about the conferences were drawn from the comments and are consistent with outcomes reported by Guyton and Fielstein (1989):\n\n    Opportunities for self-reflection improve the ability of students to think about what they have learned, accomplished, or failed to accomplish\n    Students become more aware of their strengths and weaknesses\n    Students expand their capacities to set personal goals for improvement\n    Social skills of students are enhanced when they personally showcase their accomplishments and interact with adults\n    Students take personal responsibility for their learning by sharing their accomplishments and shortcomings \" (p. 335). \n\nBenefits of the conferences from the perspectives of parents:\n\" Students take ownership of their learning\n    Students share with teachers the burden of explaining to their parents, if necessary, reasons for poor performance and behavior\n    All of the child's teachers are available in one area for private conferences, if necessary\n    Parent attendance rates are significantly higher\n    Students are not left at home wondering exactly what their teachers had to say about them\" (p. 336). \n\n\"A teacher succinctly captured the essence of the student-led parent-teacher conference concept when she stated, \"Students get to have several adults listen to just them.\" Another teacher further elaborated, \"The best part of the process is the social skills that are taught and the fact that it prepares students for future experiences such as job interviews.\"\n\nThree parents indicated that they prefer the traditional conferences, generally agreeing with one parent who wrote, \"I prefer the more formal settings with each teacher explaining grades, strengths and weaknesses, class work and homework assignments.\" However, most parents echoed an observation made in the parent survey: \"It was a good way to open up communication between him [child] and us [parents] regarding his goals and achievements.\" Another parent was more specific: \"The benefits are as follows: communication with our child in his classroom setting, through his own words, well prepared portfolio, and with teachers nearby to answer any questions we had.\"\n\nThe ethnic minority parents who responded to the open-ended survey indicated strong support for the student-led approach. One Hispanic parent indicated that the language barrier often made it uncomfortable to attend traditional parent conferences. She also shared that the presence of her child helps to remove language and other sociocultural barriers and facilitates better communication and cooperation between the school and home.\n\nFinally, the results of a survey on the students' opinions showed that a majority perceived the conferences as helpful in facilitating self-reflection, identifying strengths and areas where improvement is needed, and increasing parent involvement at home\" (p. 336).

   "Results": "\"To investigate changes in student achievement, the researchers conducted a one-way repeated measures ANOVA to analyze mean STAR scores for the beginning, middle, and end of the school year (Table 1).  Results for the study’s participants (2015/2016) indicated a significant difference between mean STAR scores, F (2, 38) = 37.22, p < .001.  Post hoc analyses using paired-sample t-tests indicated significant increases between the August and January scores, t(39) = 5.34, p < .001, d = .84, the January and May scores, t(39) = 3.82, p < .001, d = .69, and the August and May scores, t(39) = 8.74, p < .001, d = 1.38.  Results for the previous year’s students (2014/2015), whose scores were used as a control, also indicated a significant difference between mean STAR scores, F (2, 27) = 6.68, p < .05.  Post hoc analyses using paired-sample t-tests indicated a significant increase between the August and January scores, t(28) = 3.65, p < .01, d = 1.05, but no difference between the January and May scores, t(28) = .50, p > .5; a significant increase was found between the August and May scores, t(28) = 2.43, p < .05, d = .70.  To investigate changes in student motivation, researchers examined the results of the surveys issued to students and parents.  Paired sample t-tests were used to analyze Likert-scale data (Table 2). Results from the student surveys indicated a significant increase in mean item response scores for item 4 (homework habits), t(36) = 2.35, p < .05, d = .39, but a significant decrease for item 6 (excitement about school), t(36) = 3.24, p < .01, d = .53. \nResults from the parent surveys indicated a significant increase for item 1 (organizational habits), t(20) = 2.25, p < .05, d = .49, and item 4 (homework habits), t(20) = 2.77, p < .05, d = .60.  In addition, parent contact logs maintained by the teacher and school indicated an increase in overall parent contacts for the present study’s participants (93 conferences documented) when compared with the previous year’s cohort (16 conferences)\" (p. 47). ",
   "Findings": "\" Data from the STAR indicated that both groups’ mean comprehension scores increased significantly between August and January.  However, the current study’s participants’ scores continued to increase significantly between January and May, while the previous year’s cohort’s scores remained stagnant during this time period, even falling slightly though not significantly (see Table 1).  In fact, although mean STAR scores indicated that the current study’s participants started the year well behind the previous year’s cohort, t(67) = 2.05, p < .05, d = .50, by May, they had nearly equaled the previous year’s cohort’s May scores, with mean STAR scores being statistically equivalent between the two groups, t(67) = .50, p > .05.  We believe the present study’s participants’ increase in reading achievement throughout the school year is important to note, especially in light of research that suggests students from lower-SES and minority backgrounds tend to suffer more from the “fourth-grade slump” than their higher-SES counterparts (Chall, et al., 1990).  The researchers believe that the continued increase in the present study’s participants’ reading achievement could be attributed to not only the goals that students set for themselves based on the work in their portfolios, but also the sharing of these goals with a parent or responsible adult during the SLPCs (e.g., see Locke & Latham, 2002).  Indeed, the classroom teacher observed that sharing the portfolios with an adult allowed students to better see the progress they were making towards the goals they had set for themselves, which appeared to give them greater motivation to reach those goals. \" (p. 48). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Results from the motivation surveys, which were administered to only the present study’s participants and their parents, were somewhat mixed.  Although significant increases between the beginning and end-of-year ratings were found for only two items in the parent surveys and one item in the student surveys, these items seemed indicative of noticeable behavior changes over the course of the year: both students and parents seemed to feel that students had become more responsible for their homework (Item 4), and parents seemed to feel that students had become more organized during the year (Item 1).  However, student responses indicated a significant decrease in the response item ratings regarding excitement about school (Item 6).  We believe that several factors contributed to these mixed results.  First, the researcher created survey had not been validated prior to its use which makes it difficult to meaningfully interpret the results.  Second, student perceptions of the statements’ meanings likely changed over the course of the year. For example, one student who had marked a “5” for the organization item (Item 1) at the start of the year marked a “3” for this item at the end of the year, even though her answer to the question accompanying this statement on the end-of year survey indicated that she believed she had become more organized over the course of the year.  Finally the wording of some of the items might also have led to some of our mixed results, such as in the case of Item 6: “I wake up excited to go to school.”  A statement like this would likely receive a more positive response at the beginning of the year when students are generally excited about the start of school than at the end of the year, when many students are ready for summer vacation to begin.  Thus, it is difficult to make firm conclusions regarding the relationship between the implementation of SLPCs and student motivation based solely on our survey results.\" (p. 49). ",
   "Study Limitations": "Experimental and control group participants were not randomly selected. \n\nUsing parent contact with the school could have been a less reiable meaure of parental involvement. ",

That is, we answered the general question, “Does PI result in an improvement in children’s academic performance?”  This analysis suggests that parent involvement intervention programs of the kind reviewed here have a positive and significant effect on student achievement at the global level. Figure 1 shows the average effect of parent involvement on elementary school-age children’s achievement across the domains of reading, math and science under fixed and random effects models.  Figure 1 illustrates that this average effect was d= 0.43 using a fixed effects model. When the 95% confidence interval for this effect size is considered, we observe that the average effect of parent involvement on achievement ranges from d= 0.30 to 0.56 and is statistically significant.

This review focused on RCTs that assessed the effect of parent involvement on elementary school aged children. The nature of parent involvement changes with age and may require a qualitatively different type of parent involvement with the child.  The outcomes are recognized as core learning skills fundamental to educational development.  Finally, this review does not speak to the effect of parent involvement on children with special needs, such as dyslexia, etc. \n \nDefinition of Outcomes.

The school implemented an Extended Learning Time (ELT) or an advisory class, in which students were enrolled with one of the Freshmen House teachers. This class included lessons on organization, study skills, note-taking, and skills associated with academic success. The structure of the class was a decision of the Freshmen House teachers; these classes met twice per week for forty minutes\" (p. 481). \n\n\"The Peer Mentoring Program focused on support activities for entering ninth graders. Four to five upper-class students mentors were assigned to each Extended Learning Time class. The upperclassmen mentors met individually or in small groups with ninth graders to assist with various social, academic, or other school related issues. Students who had individualized educational plans (IEP) met with their case manager during this time and were not included in Extended Learning Time classes. In addition, all students were invited to attend voluntary after-school tutoring sessions. However, students with missing assignments or low grades were assigned to mandatory after-school tutoring. English and math tutors were available four days a week after school to assist students\" (p. 481). \n\n\"The final strategy, Earned Off-Campus Privileges, was designed to specifically address attendance problems in after-lunch fifth and sixth period classes. Ninth graders were able to gain off-campus lunch privileges by earning five credits. Students were not permitted to leave campus for lunch until they fulfilled this requirement. The essence of the strategy was that students had to be on-track to graduate with at least five credits before they could leave campus for lunch; that is, off-campus lunch became an earned privilege\" (p. 481-482). ",
   "Findings": "The idea behind small learning communities was to provide extra support to incoming freshmen and to strengthen the bond between teachers and fellow students. Research shows that students felt more confident about their experiences at school, and teachers shared such perceptions. \n\nThe mentoring program could be a way to enhance student motivation via extrinsic motivation ( students desiring to do well for their mentors) and to develop positive relationships with peers. \n\"Lampert (2005) described a peer support program in a Chicago area a high school, in which student failure rates had become a concern. Most freshmen students were assigned to a once per week advisory class; students in other special programs did not participate. The advisory class was composed of 30 freshmen, five mentors, and one teacher. Mentors and teachers met with the freshman students to provide academic and social support. The student mentors met regularly with advisory teachers for training related to curriculum and skill development. The mentors utilized small study groups to help ninth graders complete assignments, provide learning strategies, and support as needed. The curriculum was designed around three basic areas: attachment, achievement, and awareness. Attachment was related to what students felt toward the school; this included encouragement of students to participate in clubs and activities as well as acclimatization. Achievement addressed study skills, test-taking skills, time management, stress management, reading strategies, and note-taking skills; the counselor monitored academic achievement of all students. Awareness related to students’ self-perceptions and healthy life decisions. Lampert (2005) discovered that the failure rate after the first year had dropped 14% and participation in extra-curricular activities increased by 6%. Qualitative data indicated that students most enjoyed having a calm atmosphere in which to do homework and they really appreciated the mentors. For their part, the mentors felt they became more responsible with their work, had a new understanding of their teachers, and were more appreciative of diversity.\" (p. 483-484). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"Cauley and Jovanovich (2006) described a school that reduced freshman failure rates by nearly 8% through implementation of a student success program. This program was offered to at-risk students and taught study skills, organization, anger management skills, tolerance, and self-discipline. Students could continue classes in a study-skills format during their sophomore year, and become mentors to freshmen during their junior and senior years. Motivational studies provide indicators related to programs successes. Deci and Ryan (2000) found that one of the reasons people cannot move from extrinsic motivation to intrinsic motivation is related to feelings of lack of competence. They argued that in order for people to adopt extrinsic goals as their own, and internalize such goals, they must feel competent at related tasks. If a goal is internalized, it can become intrinsic; intrinsically motivated behaviors that stem from a sense of aptitude and effectiveness help satisfy innate human psychological need for competence.\" (p. 484).

   "Abstract": "\"The transition to high school is disruptive for many adolescents, yet little is known about the supportive relational processes that might attenuate the challenges students face as they move from middle to high school, particularly for students from more diverse backgrounds. Identifying potential buffers that protect youth across this critical educational transition is important for informing more effective support services for youth. In this study, we investigated how personal characteristics (gender, nativity, parent education level) and changes in support from family, friends, and school inﬂuenced changes in socioemotional adjustment and academic outcomes across the transition from middle to high school. The data were drawn from 252 students (50% females, 85% Latina/o). The results revealed declines in students’ grades and increases in depressive symptoms and feelings of loneliness across the high school transition, with key variation by student nativity and gender. Additionally, stable/increasing friend support and school belonging were both linked to less socioemotional disruptions as students moved from middle to high school. Increasing/stable school belonging was also linked to increases in school engagement across the high school transition. These ﬁndings suggest that when high school transitions disrupt supportive relationships with important others in adolescents’ lives, adolescents’ socioemotional well-being and, to a lesser extent, their academic engagement are also compromised. Thus, in designing transition support activities, particularly for schools serving more low-income and race/ethnic minority youth, such efforts should strive to acclimate new high school students by providing inclusive, caring environments and positive connections with educators and peers.\"",
   "Research Question": "\"First, how do adolescents’ socioemotional adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, feelings of loneliness) and academic outcomes (i.e., school engagement, grades, attendance) change as they move from middle to high school?\" (p. 2131). \n\"Second, to what extent are these changes in socioemotional and academic outcomes inﬂuenced by students’ sociodemographic characteristics?\" (p. 2131). \n\"Our third and ﬁnal research question examined the extent to which supportive relationships with important others (i.e., parents, friends, school) served as a protective factor for youths’ well-being and academic performance across the transition to high school.\" (p. 2132).

Project SPAD was a short-term longitudinal study conducted with students from two ethnic minority-concentrated middle schools (i.e., schools with a student population that were predominantly Latino and or African American) in a metropolitan area in the South\" (p. 2132). \n\n\"The current sample was 50% female and predominantly racial/ethnic minorities (85% Latina/o, 11% African American, 2% biracial, 2% White).

At Wave 1, the majority of participants (61%) did not live in a household with both biological parents. More than half of the parents (58%) did not graduate from high school.\" (p. 2132). ",

The FIML method, a preferred strategy for handling missing data, is frequently utilized in longitudinal studies, as it uses all available data and allows for generalizing research ﬁndings to the sample population\" (p. 2135). ",
   "Results": "\" As shown in Table 3, adolescents’ course grades declined signiﬁcantly across the transition to high school and their feelings of loneliness signiﬁcantly increased across this time period. Adolescents’ depressive symptoms, school engagement, and attendance did not change signiﬁcantly across the transition into high school for the overall sample.\" (p. 2135- 2136). \n\n\"Boys’ depressive symptoms were lower than their female counterparts in 8th grade; however, they reported increasing levels of depressive symptoms across the high school transition. Conversely, girls reported higher depressive symptoms in 8th grade than their male peers but reported a decline in depression across the high school transition, resulting in converging levels of depressive symptoms in 9th grade for girls and boys.\" (p. 2136). \n\n\"we observed two signiﬁcant two-way interactions that highlighted the conditional effects of student nativity on youth’s socioemotional and academic adjustment across the high school transition. First, a signiﬁcant relation between changes in feelings of loneliness by adolescent nativity was observed. Although both foreign- and US-born students reported similar levels of feelings of loneliness in 8th grade, foreign-born students experienced declines in loneliness across the high school transition, while their US-born peers reported a slight increase in loneliness over the transition. An opposite pattern, however, emerged for school engagement by nativity. Whereas foreign-born students reported a decline in their school engagement across the high school transition, USborn students experienced increasing levels of school engagement over this same period.\" (p. 2136). ",
   "Findings": "\"It should also be noted that of all the support processes, school belonging appeared to play the most prominent buffering role, inﬂuencing positive transition experiences in relation to students’ depressive symptoms, loneliness, and school engagement as well as grades in the sensitivity\nanalyses. These results add to the corpus of research highlighting the importance of students’ feelings of school belonging, speciﬁcally at this critical educational transition. Indeed, evidence suggests that school belonging is positively linked to students’ school engagement and school conduct (Demanet and Van Houtte 2012; Gillen-O’Neel and Fuligni 2013), and higher levels of school belonging are also associated with greater psychological well-being (Anderman 2002).\" (p. 2138). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"In contrast to the consistent effects of social support on students’ socioemotional well-being as they moved from middle to high school, we observed fewer effects of support on adolescents’ academics across the transition. It may be that the general relational supports assessed with our current measures are not tapping into the support most relevant to these academic outcomes, especially in relation to school engagement and attendance. Academic support, such as parents assisting their children with projects and discussing the importance of education, students studying together with their friends, or teachers providing educational enrichment activities, are all positively related to better academic performance and engagement (Hill and Tyson 2009; Martin and Dowson 2009; Ryan 2001). Future work should examine whether these academic-focused support processes are more likely to protect students from transition disruptions than more general emotional closeness with signiﬁcant others.\" (p. 2138). ",
   "Study Limitations": "\"Supportive relationships are by their very nature dynamic transactional processes between young people and their parents, friends, and school personnel. Students’ characteristics, prior well-being, and their behavior and actions may elicit certain support strategies from the important others in their lives, but with the current data we are unable to disentangle these interactive links, as we have only student reports. Similarly, in the current study, power issues limited our ability to examine the potential interactive effects of support systems, wherein high or increasing levels of support from one support source might counteract low levels of support from another source. For example, prior research on educational expectations suggests that high levels of parental expectations can buffer the negative effects of low teacher support (Benner and Mistry 2007). Future research with larger samples could use advanced statistical analyses (e.g., latent transition analyses) to examine the interactive and dynamic nature of social support from important others as adolescents move from middle to high school.\" (p. 2139).

   "Abstract": "\"Transitioning to a new school is often challenging for students with autism spectrum disorder. Few studies have examined the transition needs of students with autism spectrum disorder or the benefits of specific supports. This review synthesizes research findings on the difficulties that school transitions pose for students with autism spectrum disorder and their parents and teachers, and the strategies used to support students and parents during school transition. The review included 27 studies (10 examining the transition to primary school, 17 the transition to secondary school), with data from 443 students with autism spectrum disorder, 453 parents, and 546 teachers, across four continents (North America, Europe, Africa, and Australia). Studies reported that children with autism spectrum disorder struggled with anxiety and increased social pressure, their parents felt overwhelmed with complex placement decisions and worried about the well-being of their children, and teachers strove to provide appropriate supports to their students with autism spectrum disorder, often with inadequate resources. Findings indicated that the most useful strategies involved helping the student adjust to the new school setting, individualizing transition supports, clarifying the transition process for parents, and fostering communication both between the sending and receiving schools, and school and home.\"",

In person preferred, phone conference if not possible to address challenges, placement, review, and build relationships; student key information page: Completed by parents and pre-teachers for post-teacher. Gather information about student (interests, needs, successful strategies, behaviors, and preferences). Disseminate to new school team members; A point of contact or patron identified early in the transition process at the sending school and, later, at the receiving school, to help guide the parents and student through the transition process to ensure parents and student always have someone to help them, to simplify communication channels; Frequent (daily) face to face, home–school journal, phone, text, or e-mail contact with parents to alert team to any issues to address, and foster positive relationship; Using colloquial, everyday language with parents. consensus between parents was that phrasing things in a ‘more professional’ way could be stressful and emotionally exhausting; Teachers visit home prior to transition. parents felt supported when teachers shared their knowledge, can observe student and provide resources for the family; Individualized transition plan to meet student’s needs, including involving the student in transition planning. Plan designed and individualized for student; Attending a training or information session on ASD, and read student’s documents prior to transition and important meetings (IEP). Knowledge and understanding of student’s diagnosis, student’s reactions to transitions in general, and then applying that knowledge to transition situations” (p. 314- 315).\n\n\"Strongest evidence for use: inter-school and home-school communication, transition facilitator and student-centered planning, knowledge and adaptations. The strategies in papers with the strongest evidence of use were (1) holding a team transition planning meeting prior to the end of the school year (where possible, with staff from the new school), (2) frequent parental communication (e.g. daily), (3) developing a student key information page with childspecific important information (strengths, interests, communication, behaviors) to be written by the sending school teachers/staff and the parents, to be given to the receiving school teacher, (4) identifying a transition facilitator, a point person parents can contact throughout the transition process, (5) student-centered planning, (6) training on ASD, and (7) sensory adaptations. The first four teacher strategies therefore were focused on communication, both between the sending and receiving school staff and the school and home, addressing two core difficulties raised both by parents and teachers, as noted above (#6,17,24). The last three strategies all refer to individualization of transition supports, including identifying a particular student’s needs, training staff to be aware of such needs, and making adaptations where necessary to accommodate at the new school\" (p. 317).

   "Theoretical Basis": "\"The Dual-Capacity Building Framework for Family-School Partnerships: The framework emphasizes that in order to sustain a “cradle-to-career” relationship with children, schools need to place a dual emphasis on the process (e.g., connecting families to students’ learning goals) and organizational conditions (e.g., embedding family engagement in professional development, teaching and learning, and community collaboration; U.S. Department of Education, 2013). (p. 204). ",
   "Description": "\" The framework breaks adult capacity into four components, known as the Four Cs: (a) capabilities, (b) confidence, (c) connections, and \n (d) cognition, the combination of which are needed for staff and parents to engage in partnerships that support student learning and achievement.\" (p. 205). ",
   "Assessment": "N/A",
   "Results": "N/A",
   "Findings": "\"The school and home environments play complementary roles in promoting children’s literacy development. Receiving instructional and emotional support in both environments greatly increases children’s chances of academic success. Thus, the positive cycle of teacher–parent collaboration, cohesive support for the child, and academic gains in the child becomes self-perpetuating. Parents’ assumptions, beliefs, and worldview change when they notice positive changes in their child after partnering with teachers. They realize that their parenting skills are effective and come to understand the direct relationship between their investment in their child’s learning and positive academic and behavioral changes in their child. Observing what their child is able to achieve with appropriate supports and reinforcement also increases parents’ expectations for their child. Parents in turn begin to view themselves as more capable individuals and equal partners with professional educators in their child’s educational growth and development\" (p. 205). \n\n\"Just as the “Matthew Effect” (Stanovich, 1986) results in reciprocal causation for students, whereby students who are poor readers avoid reading and therefore continue to be poor readers, the same pattern can be seen for parents. In order for individuals to engage in goal-directed behavior, they must feel competent, which is defined as “feeling effective in one’s ongoing interactions with the social environment and experiencing opportunities to exercise and express one’s capacities” (Deci & Ryan, 2002, p. 7). In other words, when parents implement the strategies learned in family literacy programs and see improvements in their child’s literacy skills and behavior, they come to realize themselves as competent parents. This insight provides the motivation for parents to continue partnering with teachers and supporting their child’s learning.\" (p. 205-206). \n\n\"Parents who are low in social capital may be insecure about their own literacy competence, which often results in their reluctance to get involved with their child’s teachers. It is therefore critical that teachers establish positive relationships with parents at the beginning of the year and let parents know that they value their participation in school \" (p. 206). \n\n\"In addition to providing parents with suggestions of ways to support their child at home, teachers must keep communications positive, acknowledging what parents are already doing to support their child’s learning. Some additional suggestions for teachers to maintain a positive tone in school–home communication include\n•• sharing positive information with parents about their child, \n•• sending home certificates of the child’s academic and behavioral achievements and encouraging parents to display them, \n•• sending notes home to parents thanking them for their support.\" (p. 206). \n\nFor home visits (if possible): \"When teachers make home visits, they should focus on strengthening the parents’ relationship with their child by engaging in practical activities that will reinforce the parent–child bond and promote positive child development. Positive proactive parenting (e.g., praise, encouragement, affection) has been shown to be strongly associated with high child self-esteem and social and academic competence and to be protective against later disruptive behavior and substance abuse (Kumpfer & Bluth, 2004). During home visits, teachers should therefore focus on using praise and incentives effectively and using limitsetting and proactive discipline strategies to handle misbehavior. Teachers should also demonstrate stimulating ways of sharing books and model appropriate levels of literacy support to give children during activities. As parents gain independence, teachers should gradually decrease their support, coaching parents until they can conduct the activity independently. If a parent is struggling with a particular aspect of a strategy, the teacher may decide to reteach the procedure, provide modeling and guided practice, and increase the frequency of home visits. Teachers should also take care to observe authentic literacy interactions between parents and children.\" (p. 206-207). \n",
   "Findings cont": "\"Parents who are homeless have limited resources and should therefore be encouraged to take advantage of opportunities in the natural environment for developing children’s literacy skills. Below are some strategies that can be shared with parents:\n•• Reinforce literacy concepts through environmental print (e.g., signs in stores or along roadsides, names of restaurants, labels on food items). \n•• Transform daily activities into learning activities (e.g., counting out money and sorting items by color or initial consonant sound at the laundromat). \n•• Engage in creative play (e.g., songs, rhymes, poems, role-plays, make-believe). \n•• Participate in interactive games that do not require electricity or money (e.g., hand clapping, hide- and-seek, I Spy, catch). \n•• Go on an outdoor alphabet scavenger hunt, finding an item for each letter of the alphabet.\nSchools should strive to establish partnerships with local community service organizations so that families can access resources and receive assistance from a variety of service providers. In addition, these agencies may be able to provide literacy materials, lending libraries, volunteer tutors, or mentors.\" (p. 208). \n\n\"teachers have a responsibility to help foster parents understand school protocols and documents, such as the school curricula, student’s learning goals, test scores, and progress reports. Additionally, teachers can encourage foster parents to support children’s academic growth by\n•• creating a space in the home where children can draw, write, and complete homework;\n•• promoting ownership of tasks by providing children with notebooks, pencils, and crayons that personally belong to them; \n•• recognizing and valuing achievements by displaying children’s work in the home; \n•• helping children make a personal phone book listing phone numbers and addresses of friends and relatives and encouraging letter writing; \n•• visiting children’s museums, art centers, libraries, and local parks; \n•• using effective parenting practices such as encouragement, limit setting, and positive reinforcement (e.g., praise, incentives); and \n•• developing positive patterns of parent–child communication (e.g., listening, talking respectfully)\" (p. 209).

   "Description": "\"Each team member independently read the entire interview and wrote an analytic memo which summarized (a) the major events and factors that influenced the youth’s truancy behaviors over time, (b) what the school (or other actors) did in response to truancy, and (c) how that response influenced the youth, cognitively and emotionally.\" (p. 302). ",
   "Assessment": "Two team members coded the results, then the whole team reviewed such decisions. ",
   "Results": "\"School factors, including school curriculum and instructional style, relationships with teachers and counselors, and school structures and climate, were the most frequently reported influences on truancy.\" (p. 307). ",
   "Findings": "\" Frequently cited reasons for skipping class included not liking the subject matter (e.g., not interesting or enjoyable), the class was not useful to them (e.g., pointless, not relevant for their future), the class being too difficult, or not feeling engaged or challenged by the teacher or the material.  Conversely, youths would choose to attend classes where they understood the material or did well, were interested in the topic, or perceived the class to be practical or helpful (e.g., directly applicable to their future).\" (p. 307). \n\n\" youths would attend subjects that they did not like or found challenging because of their relationship with the teachers or the style that they used.  Overall, when youths did not feel engaged in the material, it was easier for them to become academically disconnected and ditch class because it was more “fun” or “worthwhile” than attending class.\" (p. 308). \n\n\"Interactions with teachers were at the center of youths’ experiences with school and had a big impact on whether they chose to attend.  In our interviews, youths reported both extremely negative and positive interactions with teachers.  Youths frequently reported not liking many of their teachers as a reason why they skipped class.  Not liking teachers was related to both instructional style (as described above) and personal relationships.  Youths perceived that some teachers did not care to be good at their job (e.g., they were only there for the paycheck) or have genuine interest in the students.  Sometimes this general dislike was associated with specific conflicts or confrontations.\" (p. 308). \n\n\"Youths described the importance of the size of the school in influencing their skipping and ditching behaviors.  Consistently, youths described skipping and ditching less at smaller schools due to structural (e.g., closed campus with nowhere to escape) and staff factors (i.e., staff knew everyone, so they would notice when a student was missing).  Large campuses provided more opportunities for youths to wander around, jump the gates unnoticed, or hide.   Youths also described the importance of class sizes.  Smaller classes allowed for calmer, controlled classroom environments and more opportunities for students to interact one-on-one with teachers. \" (p. 309). \n\n\"Six youths in the sample directly discussed involvement with gangs. Youths who joined gangs tended to experience greater and more rapid exposure to drugs and violence.  Gangs and other peer situations created a dangerous school climate and exposed students to violence inside and outside of school.  Twelve youths, even those who were not clearly affiliated with a gang, described school as being filled with too much “drama” (i.e., territorial or racial conflicts) that made school unsafe for them or prevented them from being able to focus academically.\" (p. 310). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"More than half of the youths in our sample described first skipping or ditching in elementary (6) or middle school (21).  When asked what happened as a result of their first few acts of skipping or ditching class, 23 youths characterized the school’s response as “nothing.”  They often reported that the school did not notice when they first started skipping and, therefore, that their parents were not informed.  As skipping and ditching progressed, most youths (26) reported that the school attempted to notify their parents through letters or phone calls.  Youths were often able to manipulate these lines of communication, for example by giving the school their incorrect phone number, erasing the messages on the machine, or throwing away the letters.   Almost all youths described having meetings at the school with school staff (e.g., principals, counselors) and their parents at some point.  While these meetings sometimes led to temporary reductions in truancy, they were rarely sufficient to get a youth to change his or her behavior.  For example, when asked if there were any meetings at the school with her parents, a 9th grade female reported:   \n \n'Yeah, but they [the meetings] didn’t help out.  Like all they said was “why did I do it?” and “what was the reason for it?”  And I just kept saying it wasn’t important and they was like “ok, just come to school.”  And then I would always do the same thing all over again.'\" (p. 310). \n\n\"As a result of meetings, five youths had to sign contracts or carry sheets for their teachers to sign to demonstrate their attendance, which seemed to improve attendance over and above a meeting alone.\" (p. 311).\n\nStudents reported more interesting instructional content could help reduce truancy among peers; “the need for more consistent and appropriate consequences and boundaries that were enforced” (p. 314); While youths expressed a desire for more boundaries and consequences, they also reported a desire for the school to understand their personal struggles.  Fifteen youths reported dealing with complex personal and family situations that influenced truancy (e.g., parental relationship turmoil, death in the family, deportation, unstable living situation, parental mental illness) and 18 youths reported mental health (e.g., anger issues, excessive stress, lack of motivation, sadness) or substance abuse issues.  Youths expressed a greater desire for school administrators and teachers to understand their struggles and help them address the root causes of school truancy behavior.” (p. 315).  \n\nThe need to address underlying issues seems to be something the school counselor could help with, although the heavy workload for the school counselor may mean students are not getting as adequate attention to their struggles as warranted. ",
   "Study Limitations": "Qualitative data might not be generalizable to all populations; student sinterviewed other students and were not formally trained in interviewing skills and procedures. ",
   "Notes": "Characteristics of the teacher and the learning environment strongly influenced youths’ decisions to skip or not. Also, once students felt as if the teacher did not care, they continued to skip because they did not feel the class was worth it. The need to address underlying issues seems to be something the school counselor could help with, although the heavy workload for the school counselor may mean students are not getting as adequate attention to their struggles as warranted.

   "Abstract": "\"It is well known that children’s language development lays the foundation for their literacy development, though it is difﬁcult for preschool teachers alone to consistently engage in the individual interactions necessary to boost children’s language skills. Given that parents are their children’s ﬁrst teachers, it is imperative to consider how parents can help improve their children’s language and emergent literacy development prior to formal schooling. This article reviews parent-training studies of children’s language and literacy in three contexts: parent–child book-reading; parent–child conversations; and parent–child writing. Parent training in each of these contexts has the capacity to improve children’s language and literacy, with the effects being speciﬁc to the targeted skill. All three contexts are potentially valuable sites for training parents to help their children’s language and literacy. In conclusion, parents are an undertapped resource for improving children’s language and literacy.\"",
   "Research Question": "No specific question: \"We divide our review into three types of studies or contexts for intervention. The ﬁrst and most common type of intervention revolves around teaching parents to read storybooks to children as a way to enhance their language and literacy. The second context for intervention is parent–child conversations as a springboard for children’s language and narrative development. The third type of intervention focuses on parents’ assistance for children’s writing as another important component of emergent literacy.\" (p. 103). ",

   "Description": "Dialogic reading, elaborative reminiscing, and joint-writing activities",
   "Assessment": "N/A",
   "Results": "\"A meta-analysis (Mol et al., 2008) of dialogic book reading intervention studies with parents of preschool or kindergarten-age children concluded that these sorts of reading programs explained about eight per cent of the variance in children’s language skills in those studies that used measures of expressive language as an outcome. Dialogic reading accounted for only four per cent of children’s language skill when the language measures included receptive as well as expressive vocabulary. The authors believe this pattern highlights the importance of interactions in which parents ask open-ended questions and children actively participate by formulating their own responses. Moreover, they assert that this ﬁnding supports the notion that the quality of book reading is as important as the frequency of book reading for language development.\" (p. 106). \n\n\" researchers trained one group of mothers to talk in more elaborative ways about past events with their children at 21, 25, and 29 months of age. Speciﬁcally, mothers were encouraged to use more ‘wh-’ or open-ended questions containing new information about the event, and to praise and expand upon children’s utterances with another elaborative question. By 32 months, children of trained mothers were providing more utterances containing event information in conversations with their mothers compared to children of mothers in the control group, whom researchers visited in the home the same number of times but who did not receive special training in conversation. By 44 months, the children of trained mothers told richer narratives to a researcher than did the children of untrained mothers. Speciﬁcally, the children of trained mothers provided more actions in their narratives than did children in the control group. This study included mothers from a wide range of education levels. About half of the mothers had only a high-school education, whereas the other half of mothers had completed some university training or had a tertiary or postgraduate degree. Critically, however, the intervention worked equally well with less and more educated mothers. Both groups of mothers increased their elaborative talk with their children; there was no inter action between maternal education and training group in the effects on children’s narrative skills at age 3–1/2.\" (p. 109-110). \n",
   "Findings": "\"Dialogic reading is a method of reading picture books that draws upon a variety of strategies used successfully in language interventions with young children. The goal of the interaction is to encourage the child to participate actively. Parents are taught ways to facilitate their children’s learning so that the role of narrator slowly shifts from the parent to the child as the story becomes more familiar over many readings. The intervention consists of teaching parents strategies to support children’s acquisition of the story vocabulary and discussion of the story plot. Parents are trained to ask open-ended questions, evaluate, repeat or expand upon the child’s responses, follow the child’s line of interest, and connect the story to real events in the child’s life.\" (p. 104). \n\n\"The impact of parents’ dialogic reading on children’s language and, on occasion their literacy, has been replicated repeatedly in studies that have included, in addition to parent training, a condition in which preschool teachers are taught dialogic reading that is adapted for group reading in the classroom. The classroom context is beyond the parameters of the literature\nunder review here. Thus, we will just brieﬂy state some ﬁndings related to the role of parents in children’s early language and literacy from studies that included both home and classroom interventions. Results from all of these studies show that conditions including parent training consistently yield the strongest effects of the intervention. For instance, Whitehurst et al. (1994) compared a preschool dialogic reading intervention with a combined preschool and parent-implemented intervention and a control group in a low-income sample. Immediately after the six-weekinterventionthechildren in the intervention displayed signiﬁcantly better expressive language skills than their non-treatment peers. Moreover, children in the combined treatment condition, which included dialogic reading at home and school, signiﬁcantly outperformed those in the school-only condition on the same measure of expressive language. Even stronger evidence for the importance of the role of parents in their children’s early learning comes from another study with a low-income sample by Lonigan and Whitehurst (1998) in which they contrasted four conditions, a home-based model, a school-based model, and a combined condition in which children attended classes where teachers had implemented dialogic reading and parents were using similar intervention techniques in the home, and ano-treatment control group. Signiﬁcant effects of the reading intervention were obtained, though the largest effects were found in conditions that included a parent-reading component.\" (p. 106-107). \n\n\"The meta-analysis by Mol et al. (2008) indicated, however, that parentled dialogic reading interventions were not as effective for children from low-income families or for older preschoolers. Other ways of reading books with preschoolers besides dialogic reading have yet to be tested experimentally with parents (but for an effective researcher-led intervention with older and more advanced preschoolers, see Reese and Cox, 1999). If we want to reach children beyond middle-class populations with effective interventions for their language skills, then we need to know more about cultural differences in the role of books in the home and how parents structure shared reading with their children\" (p. 108). \n\n\"Storytelling about personally experienced events is one promising context for intervention. Parents in a diverse range of cultures talk with their children about past events (Miller et al., 1990), although the frequency and style of past event talk varies across cultures and income levels (Leyva et al., 2008; Wang, 2001). Moreover, personal narratives are the ﬁrst stories that children tell (e.g. Reese, 1999). In the ﬁrst parent intervention of this type, Peterson et al. (1999) trained a group of low-income Canadian Anglo mothers to talk in topic-extending ways with their preschool children. The intervention focused on increasing parents’ use of open-ended questions during past event narratives, particularly their use of ‘where’ and ‘when’ questions.\" (p. 109). ",
   "Findings cont": "\" We included three conditions in our design: low-income parents of four-year-old children attending Head Start were\nassigned either to dialogic reading, elaborative reminiscing, or a no treatment control condition. The intervention consisted of training parents in the prescribed conversational technique or, for parents in the control group, conducting a parent interview at a home visit in the Fall of the child’s last year of Head Start. In the spring of that year, post-tests of children’s language and narrative skills revealed that elaborative reminiscing boosted the quality of children’s story retelling narratives in comparison to dialogic reading. Elaborative reminiscing was also effective in promoting children’s story comprehension in comparison to the dialogic reading and the no-treatment control conditions. Importantly, these effects of training held for bilingual and monolingual children, and regardless of children’s racial/ethnic background. Therefore, training parents in elaborative conversations poses a promising alternative or supplement to bookreading for enhancing the language and especially the narrative development of children from a range of social classes and cultures.\" (p. 110-111). \n\nThough there is not much research into developing early writing skills with this age group, one specific intervention did address this:\n\" Children whose parents received the joint-writing intervention had greater gains in alphabetical skills. In contrast, children whose parents received the joint storybook reading intervention had greater gains in linguistic skills such as receptive and expressive language. These differences were present even after accounting for child age, home literacy practices and pre-test scores on alphabetic skills and linguistic competencies. This study shows that training parents in joint-writing has speciﬁc beneﬁts to children’s literacy skills beyond those of joint storybook sharing and drawing/painting activities. Thus, parent intervention programs focused on emergent writing are a promising area that deserves future exploration as it has important implications for children's literacy development\" (p. 111-112).

   "Abstract": "\"Parenting programs have the potential to improve the health and well-being of parents and children. A challenge for providers is to recruit and retain parents in programs. Studies researching engagement with programs have largely focused on providers’, policy makers’, or researchers’ reflections of their experience of parents’ participation. We conducted a systematic review of qualitative studies where parents had been asked why they did or did not choose to commence, or complete programs, and compared these perceptions with those of researchers and those delivering programs. We used data-mining techniques to identify relevant studies and summarized findings using framework synthesis methods. Six facilitator and five barrier themes were identified as important influences on participation, with a total of 33 subthemes. Participants focused on the opportunity to learn new skills, working with trusted people, in a setting that was convenient in time and place. Researchers and deliverers focused on tailoring the program to individuals and on the training of staff. Participants and researchers/ deliverers therefore differ in their opinions of the most important features of programs that act as facilitators and barriers to engagement and retention. Program developers need to seek the views of both participants and deliverers when evaluating programs.\"",

Skills valued by parents included addressing a lack of confidence, improving their ability to parent well, goal setting, and program-specific skills that supported their personal development.\" (p. 130). \n\n\"Using trusted or known people to recruit to and deliver the course highlighted tutors who were nonjudgmental and empathized with participants; this was emphasized in almost half of the papers reporting the participant perspective.\" (p. 130). \n\n\"This was an important theme for participants (60% of papers), who highlighted meeting others, exchanging ideas, feeling it was safe to talk, and receiving support from peers as valuable in encouraging them to take part in programs. Only three (30%) of the researchers’ papers reported features of the group experience as important to facilitate parents’ participation.\" (p. 130). \n\n\"Focused message. Being able to tailor the content of a parenting course to the needs of the participants was the most important facilitator reported by the researchers when reporting their perspective (in eight of the nine). Having flexibility within the program included using a range of formats to suit the abilities of the parents, their culture, and the child’s behavior/difficulties. Participants also appreciated having tailored sessions that were relevant to their situations and children.\" (p. 130). ",
   "Findings cont": "\"The time and place of the course delivery were important to participants with community venues, colocalization with child care, and evening classes all mentioned. Researcher papers mentioned similar points and suggested that flexible access facilitated engagement of families.\" (p. 133). \n\n\"Very few studies identified behavioral barriers to engaging with programs. Some participants highlighted the difficulties in changing their own behavior and would have preferred strategies to change their child’s behavior. Similarly, the researchers mentioned that some \nparents did not accept that child behavior can be modified with a parenting approach, resulting in a mismatch between expectations of parents and the program goals.\" (p. 133). \n\n\" Participants disliked didactic delivery and a lack of focus of the program. Papers reporting researcher perspectives were more likely to report the training and skills of the deliverer as a barrier, with those who lacked confidence or who misunderstood the theoretical evidence for the approach diluting a program’s message. Researchers also reported potential cultural barriers, for example, impediments arising from attempts to deliver a program developed in another continent or a lack of consumer support within particular communities. These features were not identified by participants themselves.\" (p. 133). \n\n\"Participant constraints. Fourteen participant perception papers identified at least one issue within this theme, particularly group dynamics (the fear of attending groups, reluctance to talk in a group setting, suspicion of others, and large differences between participants). Competing demands on parents’ time and resources, including practical issues such as child care for other children, and the frequency and timing of sessions, which did not fit working patterns or other commitments, were important. Barriers associated with stigma and gender included fathers feeling uncomfortable in predominantly female groups, social status, and the fear of being labeled a “bad” parent.\" (p. 133-134). \n\n\"Social and cultural barriers. Participant lifestyle issues were reported by about half of the included studies, including mixed parenting styles, complex and chaotic lifestyles, \nfrequent house moves, and poor family support to attend courses. A range of socioeconomic, ethnic, language, and literacy barriers were also mentioned as having an impact on attendance at parenting programs.\n\" (p. 134). ",

   "Abstract": "\" To support national policy initiatives in early childhood education and to determine reasons for low enrolment in services from families in disadvantaged areas, the authors investigated the views and practices of 101 families from disadvantaged communities. Families with a child aged 3–5 years were recruited from urban, rural and remote areas of NSW, Australia. Researchers interviewed primary carers in their home or other preferred location to explore barriers and facilitators to participate in early childhood education and care services. In addition to asking parents directly about barriers and facilitators, the interview included a questionnaire and investigated family engagement in and response to services using questions guided by Ecocultural theory. The relationships between service enrolment and family engagement with other family variables were investigated. Families emphasised quality above cost as the primary factor inﬂuencing participation in services. Child enrolment in an early childhood service and higher levels of family engagement with the service were signiﬁcantly more likely when families perceived childcare to be safe, when there were high levels of family connectedness, and when families were involved in other professionals (e.g. social welfare).

   "Results": "“Enrolment patterns did not differ signiﬁcantly by location. Nine children out of 50 in the urban group (18.0 %), ten out of 39 children in the rural group (25.6 %) and two out of 12 children in the remote group (16.7 %) did not attend any formal early childhood services. Chi-square tests showed no signiﬁcant association between child attendance at an ECEC service and the following demographic variables: mother and father education; family structure; family income; perception of ﬁnancial well-being; location; birth order of target child; cultural background; father hours in paid employment; mother and father age; number of children in the family; and whether or not the child had a diagnosed disability. A statistically signiﬁcant relationship was found between child enrolment and the number of hours; a mother was in paid employment, t(93) =-4.15, p\\.001.” (p. 287). \n\n“A statistically signiﬁcant relationship was found between attendance at early childhood services and parents’ total score on how concerned they were about the informal support available to them, t(19.33) = 2.27, p = .035. It seems that those who were concerned with the informal support available to them were less likely to use formal support including ECEC services.” (p. 288). \n\n“There was a signiﬁcant positive relationship between family engagement in ECEC services and the ﬂexibility of work hours for mothers, F(3,78) = 6.99, p\\.001. Flexibility was more important than hours spent in paid employment (which was not shown to be signiﬁcant). Family income was only important in that there was a positive correlation between mothers’ income and level of ﬂexibility in their working hours, r(78) = .40, p\\.001.” (p. 288-289). \n\n“A positive relationship was found between level of family engagement in ECEC services and consistency between the parents in decision making, F(3,66) = 9.06, p\\.001. The connectedness of the family as a whole was also found to be important, F(3,79) = 5.33, p = .002.

This result suggests that families who are highly engaged in ECEC services are more likely to access information and support from professionals.” (p. 289).\n\n“There was a signiﬁcant relationship between family engagement in ECEC and the families involvement with a religious organisation, F(3,78) = 3.35, p = .023 in the direction of more religious families being more engaged with services.” (p. 289).\n\n“The most frequent concern was about quality of the service (73.0 % raised this issue) and cost of services (raised by 70.0 % of parents).

   "Findings cont": "“In discussing the engagement of disadvantaged families, more attention is often given to the issue of service cost, prompting government strategies such as subsidy schemes. It is important to note that, in this research, the barriers and facilitators most frequently raised by the parents related to elements of service quality. Cost was not raised at all by parents who did not have a child enrolled in an ECEC service.” (p. 292). \n\nParents in this study cited the importance of quality over the consideration of cost; if parents perceived programs to be lacking in quality, this was a larger deterrent than cost of programs.  \n",
   "Study Limitations": "The study included 101 people so generalizing to other populations may be difficult. The parents that did indicate interest in interviewing may have been ones that show more initiative in their children’s care already, so this may have represented a certain type of parents that were interviewed.

   "Abstract": "\"A meta-analysis is undertaken, including 52 studies, to determine the influence of parental involvement on the educational outcomes of urban secondary school children. Statistical analyses are done to determine the overall impact of parental involvement as well as specific components of parental involvement. Four different measures of educational outcomes are used. These measures include an overall measure of all components of academic achievement combined, grades, standardized tests, and other measures that generally included teacher rating scales and indices of academic attitudes and behaviors. The possible differing effects of parental involvement by race and socioeconomic status are also examined. The results indicate that the influence of parental involvement overall is significant for secondary school children. Parental involvement as a whole affects all the academic variables under study by about .5 to .55 of a standard deviation unit. The positive effects of parental involvement hold for both White and minority children.\"",
   "Research Question": "\"Can parental involvement really improve the educational outcomes of urban children? More specifically, four issues are especially pertinent to parents and educators. First, to what degree is parental involvement associated with higher levels of school achievement among urban students? Second,do school programs of parental involvement positively influence urban students? Third, what aspects of parental involvement help those students the most? Fourth, does the relationship between parental involvement and academic achievement hold across racial groups?\" (p. 83). ",

Study quality and the use of random samples were graded on a 0 (lowest) to 3 (highest) scale. We computed interrater reliability by calculating the percentage of agreement on the definition of parental involvement, issues of randomization, the specific components examined in each study, and quality of the study. Interrater reliability was 100% on whether a study examined parental involvement, 96% for the specific components of parental involvement examined in a given study,and 92% for the quality of the study. For the specific components of quality, interrater agreement percentages were 98% for randomization, 94% for avoiding mono-method bias, 94% for avoiding mono-operation bias, 92% for avoiding selection bias, and 96% for using a specific definition of parental involvement.\" (p. 87). ",
   "Results": "\"Among the parental involvement programs, the effect sizes were smaller than those that emerged for parental involvement overall. All the programs included in this meta-analysis did not include controls for SES. The overall effect size was statistically significant at .36 (p < .05) of a standard deviation. Of the three specific measures of academic achievement, the effect sizes for grades and other measures were statistically significant, but the result for standardized tests was not.\" (p. 93). \n\n\"The largest effect sizes emerged for parental expectations. For overall academic achievement, the effect size for parental expectations was .88 (p < .0001) of a standard deviation. The results were similar for standardized tests and other measures. The results for parental expectations were quite consistent among the various studies examined. Therefore, the confidence intervals were generally narrow, especially for standardized tests\" (p. 95). \n\n\"The effect sizes for parental style were generally around .40 of a standard deviation. The effect sizes for parental expectations were above .80. These regressions coefficients were the largest of all the specific components of parental involvement that were examined\" (p. 101). ",
   "Findings": "\"For the purposes of this study, parental involvement was defined as parental participation in the educational processes and experiences of their children.\" (p. 83). \n\n\"One of the most vital aspects of this study was its examination of specific components of parental involvement to see which aspects influenced student achievement. One of the patterns that emerged from the findings is that subtle aspects of parental involvement such as parental style and expectations had a greater impact on student educational outcomes than some of the more demonstrative aspects of parental involvement such as having household rules and parental attendance and participation at school functions\" (p. 100). \n\n\"It is also true that many of the parental involvement programs included in this study focused on minority students. As a result, this metaanalysis not only suggests that parental involvement overall may reduce the achievement gap but that programs of this nature may help as well. The fact that this study suggests that parental involvement may reduce the achievement gap between White and some racial minority groups has important implications. These results confirm the results of other studies that suggest that family and other domestic factors can contribute to reducing this gap (Jeynes, 1999, 2003)\" (p. 103). ",

   "Study Limitations": "\"The primary limitation of this meta-analysis or any meta-analysis is that it is restricted to analyzing the existing body of literature. Therefore, even if the researcher conducting the quantitative integrations sees ways the studies included could have been improved, there is no way to implement those changes. A second limitation of a meta-analysis is that the social scientist is limited to addressing the same research questions addressed in the aggregated studies. For example, it would be advisable to have parental expectations measures from all the studies included, but one can only aggregate the existing results\" (p. 104). ",
   "Notes": "This study provides evidence that parental involvement can help reduce the achievement gap between students of a minority group and White students."

   "Abstract": "\"The idea that parental involvement has positive inﬂuence on students’ academic achievement is so intuitively appealing that society in general, and educators in particular, have considered parental involvement an important ingredient for the remedy for many problems in education. The vast proportion of the literature in this area, however, is qualitative and nonempirical. Among the empirical studies that have investigated the issue quantitatively, there appear to be considerable in consistencies. A meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the quantitative literature about the relationship between parental involvement and students’ academic achievement. The ﬁndings reveal a small to moderate, and practically meaningful, relationship between parental involvement andacademic achievement. Through moderator analysis, it was revealedthat parental aspiration/expectation for children’s education achievement has the strongest relationship, whereas parental home supervision has the weakest relationship, with students’ academic achievement. In addition, the relationship is stronger when academic achievement is represented by a global indicator (e.g.,GPA) than by a subject-speciﬁc indicator (e.g.,math grade).Limitations of the study are noted, and suggestions are made for future studies.\"",
   "Research Question": "\"1. What is the strength of the general relationship between measured parental involvement and students’ academic achievement? 2. What are some potential study features that have moderating effect on the relationship between parental involvement and students’ academic achievement?\" (p. 5). ",

Forthislarge group of correlation coefﬁcients between parental involvement and academic achievement, the average correlation is relatively high (r = .33). But for studies that focused on achievement in more speciﬁc academic areas(e.g., math, science), the average correlation coefﬁcients are obviously lower, but comparable (approximatelyr = .18). We are not entirely clear about the reasons for this observation. However, we believe that general school achievement, such as that represented by school GPA, may be a better indicator for students’ overall academic achievement than those that focused on a speciﬁc academic area (e.g.,math grade or reading test score). There are two reasons to support our belief. First, obviously, general GPA is a more comprehensive indicator of academic achievement than subject-speciﬁc indicators. Second, from the measurement perspective, GPA is a composite of multiple measurements, and a composite is generally more reliable than one of its sub-components.\" (p. 12-13). \n\n\"The results here appear to suggest that parental involvement, as represented by parents’ supervision of children at home (e.g., home rules for watching TV, for doing schoolwork, etc.), has the weakest relationship with students’ academic achievement,whereas parents’ aspiration and expectation for children’s educational achievement appears to have the strongest relationship with students’ academic achievement\" (p. 13). \n",

   "Abstract": "Objectives: This article presents a systematic review of the literature on evaluative studies of truancy interventions. Method: Included studies evaluating truancy interventions appearing in peer-reviewed academic journals from 1990 to 2007. Findings: In total, 16 studies were assessed. Eight studies used group comparison designs and eight studies used one-group pretest/posttest designs. Studies varied on sample sizes, definitions of truant behavior, focus of interventions, and dependent measures. Conclusions: Six studies produced useful and promising interventions including contingency management, school reorganization, punitive measures, community partnerships, and family-oriented activities. The substantial methodological shortcomings, inconsistent definitions, and lack of replication demonstrate a need for more and better evaluation studies to provide a more definitive knowledge base to guide effective truancy interventions for practitioners.",

Licht et al. (1991) found that special education students with poor attendance who received a program of tangible rewards, such as fast-food coupons, movie tickets, or school supplies, for attendance and punctuality, followed by telephone calls to parents, subsequent to any further absence, stabilized their attendance rates, whereas attendance for matched controls continued to decline. In a notable negative finding, Newsome (2004) found no difference in postintervention attendance for a group of middle school students who received solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) in a group format, as compared to students in a control group. Readers should interpret this negative finding cautiously due to this study’s small sample size. Single-group studies indicated improved attendance for high-absentee students through incentive-based programs (Ford & Sutphen, 1996), student support programs (Baker & Jansen, 2000), and relationship-building and monitoring efforts (Lehr et al., 2004).\" (p. 163-168).

A small body of literature documents a lack of collaboration between the child welfare and education systems. This study explores commonalities and differences in perspectives between child welfare and education system stakeholders. It draws on findings from a multi-county exploratory study on educational services for foster youth. The findings in this study identify several systemic barriers including placement instability within the child welfare system, limited financial resources of schools, and poor interagency communication. In addition, differences in the perceptions of school and child welfare agency personnel regarding the needs of foster children in school, problems encountered in enrolling children in school, and the role and motives of each agency in addressing these needs and problems are identified. These differences point to both the challenges involved in improving communications and collaboration between the two systems, as well as the opportunities to improve educational services to children in foster care.\"",

   "Abstract": "\"Children in care frequently experience poor educational outcomes, which in turn have been linked to a number of adverse circumstances later in life. Accordingly, it is important to identify the educational experiences of children in care and what they consider to be their needs in this space. This systematic review of qualitative research aimed to identify and synthesise the findings of relevant studies that documented the experiences of children in care in regard to their school experiences. Inclusion criteria included English language, peer-reviewed, qualitative, or mixed-methods studies that examined the educational experiences of children currently in care or youth/adults who had previously been in care. Five online databases were systematically searched, along with manual hand searching of a relevant journal and reference lists to identify relevant studies. Eleven studies were identified. Thematic analysis was employed to identify five primary themes: the importance of school being a ‘safehaven’; the importance of relationships with teachers and peers; children’s mental health, behaviour and educational experiences; children in caretaking control; and what children in care say they need to improve their educational experiences. Results illustrate the important role of teachers and the need for children in care to have their opinions acknowledged in the decision-making process. The review provides future direction and recommendations for research, school policy, and practice.\"",

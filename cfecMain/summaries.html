                            Increasing Census Responses Including More Young Children
                        </h4>
                            <p>Who is missed?</p>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Grandparents raising children not counting them as their own; aunts, cousins, etc. raising children not counting them as their own; foster children; children that go between two households of separated parents; those that are temporarily in someone else’s home with no permanent address of their own so they would not otherwise have a census delivered to them; people not speaking English at all in the home so they may forego trying to find a census in their native language; some parents that may struggle with literacy skills.  </p>
                            <p>Biggest factors are confusion about if someone actually needs to be counted or why young children need to be counted at all (some assume they are already known about). Also, the fear of repercussions from landlords and fear of being an undocumented citizen also prevent people from counting all people. </p>
                        </div>
                            <p>Strategies to Ease Worries/ Increase Census Response</p>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>Research shows letting people know how easy and convenient it is (one can fill out the census on paper, over the phone, or online all from one’s own personal living space and it takes about 10 minutes) and that the information recorded is private (no personal identifying information is shared; IF a census worker shares private information, the penalty is up to 5 years in prison or a $250,000 fine; collectors of census data cannot release information to other agencies or people like a landlord) are ways to increase response rates. People are more assured by these things! </p>
                            <p>It is helpful to provide real-world examples of what might be missed out on if children are left off the census- that leaving them off could lead to them being excluded from many benefits in the next 10 years; that many changes have occurred benefitting children due to counting children in the 2010 census.  </p>
                            <p>New ways of reaching families when physical contact is restricted: The use of social media and texting families IF they have access to a cellphone and consent to receiving messages is helpful; teachers can email families with info graphs about the importance of the census; fact sheets can be distributed at still-frequented places such as food banks. </p>
                            <p>Tell families they can choose from these other languages when filling out the census via phone and online: Spanish, Chinese (online: simplified Chinese; by phone: Mandarin and Cantonese), Vietnamese, Korean, Russian, Arabic, Tagalog, Polish, French, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and Japanese.  </p>
                        </div>
                            <p>Counties in SC that currently are at only 15-30% response rate: Allendale and Hampton. The final response rate for these counties in 2010 was less than 50%. Also, McCormick and Jasper counties also had less than 50% response rate in 2010. Most counties in SC in 2010 fell into the mid- 60% for final response rate- this was in line with the national average. <a href="https://www.censushardtocountmaps2020.us/">(Source: https://www.censushardtocountmaps2020.us/) </a></p>

                        <h4>Summary of Best Forms of Parental Engagement </h4>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                            <p>The value of parental engagement for student success has been extensively studied by researchers in the field of education, psychology, social work, and various other academic disciplines. To some, it may be difficult to discern the difference between parental involvement and parental engagement. The latter term is “characterised by the greatest exercise of parental agency” (Goodall & Montgomery, 2014, p. 405). This engagement may take the form of parenting behaviors not easily observable by others. According to Goodall & Montgomery (2014), there is a favorable association between engagement in the home environment that promotes learning and the achievement of students. In a review of the meta-analyses he conducted, Jeynes (2011) concluded less overt forms of engagement, such as “maintaining high expectations of children, communicating with children, and parental style” (p. 10) had the greatest influence on achievement.  </p>
                            <p>One such example of parenting behaviors that promote student achievement is academic socialization, which Hill & Tyson (2009) describe as “communicating parental expectations for education and its value or utility, linking schoolwork to current events, fostering educational and occupational aspirations, discussing learning strategies with children, and making preparations and plans for the future” (p. 5). Support for the positive effect of academic socialization (over actual involvement with the school) on achievement has been found in the meta-analysis involving middle school students (Hill & Tyson, 2009) and among high school students (Wang & Sheikh-Khali, 2014). Further, in a study by James, Rudy, & Dotterer (2019), involvement at the home level was in a positive way related to GPA more than involvement in the schools for all ethnic groups examined (African American, Asian American, European American, and Hispanic American children).  </p>
                            <p>Parental style is also a notable factor that has been examined as related to student success. Many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of an authoritative parenting style; however, the findings in one study show that while this holds true for Caucasian and Asian families, the evidence in favor of authoritative parenting is not applicable to African American and Hispanic families (Spera, 2005). In another study by Taylor, Clayton, & Rowley (2004), the researchers found that while components of authoritarian parenting were linked with poorer outcomes for European American children, similar results were not found for African American families. Gaining further understanding of why these discrepancies exist is a popular topic in the literature.  </p>
                            <p>While an overwhelming amount of research indicates the importance of less concrete parental behaviors, knowing this information does not discount the significance of parents’ interactions in the actual school setting. These findings presented highlight that engagement is not defined by strict guidelines that create an out-of-reach goal for many parents; rather, all parents can feasibly play a significant role in contributing to their children’s school success.   </p>

                        <h4>Student-Led Parent-Teacher Conferences </h4>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>Parents and school personnel are always looking for new ways in which to increase the sense of competency students feel. An emerging trend that has been researched is the idea of student-led parent-teacher conferences. With these, the idea is to include children in explaining their progress to parents by allowing them to direct the course of the parent-teacher meeting.  </p>
                        <p>This idea was studied in a Title 1 school with specific instructions regarding how students could lead such conferences. The example details steps that the student could take, including greeting the parent and introducing the reason for the meeting, showing the parent some self-selected work samples, speaking about what work he or she has enjoyed, and discussing goals to be met in the future (Wolfram, Shull, Mims, & Nelson, 2016). In this study, it was found that parents and students both agreed that the students had become more accountable for getting their homework done overall, and parents believed their children’s organizational skills had been strengthened over the year (Wolfram et al., 2016). The children in this study’s reading scores also improved at a greater rate than the control group, which researchers hypothesize to be due to the setting of and sharing of goals with a parent (Wolfram et al. 2016).  </p>
                        <p>Borba and Olvera (2001) suggested a six-stage model for conducting a student-led parent-teacher conference. Throughout the stages, students prepare work samples for a portfolio, self-reflect on their work in each subject, have a letter sent home to their parents regarding the conference, complete their portfolios, are trained in how to lead the conference, practice with their peers, hold a 15-minute conference, then instruct parents to write a letter critiquing the student’s performance at the conference (Borba & Olvera, 2001). For the most part, parents found the conferences to be a very positive experience and had comments to make about students’ improvements. Parents perceived that students were able to assess their strengths and weaknesses through the self-reflection, believed students improved social skills by conversing with the parents, and that students were led to feel a sense of personal accountability by being the ones to explain their work (Borba & Olvera, 2001). One teacher commented that this was a great opportunity to have many adults listen solely to the child for a moment and that children could develop valuable skills for interactions in future interviews or conferences (Borba & Olvera, 2001). Students found the conferences just as advantageous, citing finding the time for self-reflection to be useful and perceiving their parents to be more engaged at home (Borba & Olvera, 2001). </p>
                        <p>Some themes that emerge from the research include allowing children the time to self-reflect and assess their own goals, strengths, and weaknesses. Though the utilization of student-led parent-teacher conferences is not widely covered in the research, there is evidence that they can facilitate the development of very important skills children can use throughout life. While some parents did prefer the traditional structure of the teacher-led parent-teacher conferences (Borba & Olvera, 2001), the majority of participants felt it was an innovative strategy to get students and parents to engage in conversations about student achievement.  </p>

                        <h4>Evidence-Based Teaching Practices </h4>
                        <div class="paragraph">
                        <p>There are certain strategies teachers may use to promote a learning environment where all students feel competent in their abilities. While trying to find specific strategies to use may seem overwhelming, research has detailed evidence-based strategies for helping to increase teacher’s skills of assisting their students. Behaviors that strengthen a sense of motivation through improving the overall climate of the classroom are especially helpful. </p>
                        <p>Oftentimes, being ascribed the label of high-achieving or low-achieving holds more weight than people realize. Though school personnel may deem it necessary to understand where students are at academically by using such labels, their attitudes in the classroom are inadvertently influenced by the stigma attached. According to Cooper (1979), teachers may give high-achieving students more opportunities than low-achieving to answer a question correctly after the student is unable to give the correct answer. When it is determined that a student labeled as low-achieving also has a learning disability, the chance that teachers will set high expectations is further diminished (Pugach & Warger, 2001). Understanding how biases operate in the classroom can lead to an awareness of how to provide equal opportunities for all students.  </p>
                        <p>In addition to monitoring one’s own perceptions of student abilities, teaching students to take on certain attitudes about the learning process is key. The cultivation of a concept called growth mindset- that is, the idea that one’s academic capabilities are not fixed, but rather can be strengthened with practice- can be used particularly with children that may be not be confident in their academic efforts (Garwood & Ampuja, 2019). Teachers can facilitate sessions where students brainstorm ways to overcome their difficulties as well as use their own experiences in problem solving as a way to put growth mindset to use (Garwood & Ampuja, 2019). Students may work to change statements of limitation (e.g. I can’t understand; I’m no good) into statements characteristic of a growth mindset (e.g. I will understand this with time; I work hard and that’s what matters) (Garwood & Ampuja, 2019). In Ng (2018), the neuroscience of growth mindset is explored, with the research positing that “growth-minded individuals may neutralize the affective response to negative feedback, which could be indicated by neural activation” (p. 4). </p>
                        <p>Teachers can also create a sense of equality in the classroom by the way they organize groups of children for activities. Rather than being grouped solely on academic ability, students may collaborate during activities with other students that are interested in similar topics through the use of “flexible grouping” (McDonald et al., 2006, p. 291). Students can learn strategies from their peers without the feeling that one is better than the other through this process (Rubie-Davies, Peterson, Sibley, & Rosenthal, 2014).  </p>
                        <p>Another strategy to create an atmosphere conducive to increasing motivation is the articulation of a specific expectation: that attempting to genuinely grasp a concept rather than only attempting to perform well is a better way to approach learning. (Rubie-Davies, 2007). Mastery- versus performance-based goals may help reduce anxiety over completing assignments and lead to greater enjoyment of tasks (Ames, 1990). When students can shift the focus from attaining to best possible grade to really understanding their work, they may feel more inspired during the learning process (Rubie-Davies, 2007). </p>
                        <p>These practices can be taught to all teachers to help enhance the students’ sense of competency and promote motivation in the classroom. Though some refer to more abstract concepts, specific behaviors can be integrated into the teaching curriculum to put these strategies to use. Groups of students labeled as less likely to succeed especially benefit from such practices. </p>

                            <p>The purpose of this study was to review previous literature to highlight differences between parental involvement and parental engagement, address how reducing microaggressions can alter the classroom climate, and suggest how to get new teachers to value active collaboration with parents (Fenton, Ocasio-Stoutenburg, & Harry, 2017). The use of the term involvement generally refers to opportunities given by the school to parents to be involved in their children’s schooling, whereas engagement draws upon the choices parents make themselves to be a part of their children’s education (Fenton et al., 2017). Previous research has indicated school officials generally create opportunities for parents to become involved that suit what schools think of as parental involvement instead of appreciating parents’ own efforts to be involved in a way that best suits their own lifestyle (as cited in More, Hart, & Cheatham, 2013).  </p>
                            <p>Research illustrates the unfortunate truth that students belonging to a minority group are suspended more often than White students, and the same is true for students with disabilities (as cited in US Department of Education, 2015). Parents of such students may be on the receiving end of microaggressions in their interactions with teachers, which include the teacher speaking in a condescending manner toward parents, displaying disapproving non-verbal expressions, and teachers assuming they know what is best for the child while the parent is an ignorant party (Fenton et al., 2017).  </p>
                            <p>Previous researchers have argued against the idea that some students were destined to do poorly while others were on the path to succeed and instead focused on how to best equip all families with the tools they needed to succeed. Creating and sustaining relationships with parents as well as understanding each viewpoint is shaped by cultural influences is something school personnel need to be aware of (Fenton et al., 2017). Some research points to the importance of the school’s principal in determining how relationships will be built with parents- by not only acting as a figure in the school but as a member in community events, the principal will display his or her value of establishing close relationships with the families (as cited in Khalifa, 2012). Response to Treatment and Positive Behavioral Interventional Supports are two such approaches included in this article as helpful in responding to the needs of a diverse range of students- these types of interventions operate from a model that includes many levels in the support system which all actively communicate with each other when deciding upon making the call that a student has a learning or behavioral difficulties (as cited in Bal, Kozleski, Schrader, Rodriguez, & Pelton, 2014). Soliciting the knowledge of the parent concerning student progress is valuable part of these interventions because it can help school personnel consider all angles when making judgements about student behavior (Fenton et al., 2017).  </p>
                            <p>When teachers feel they are adept at making judgements about a student’s behavior without fully understanding the parent’s perspective, they may make inaccurate assumptions and therefore label a child as defiant. Establishing an environment where the parent’s viewpoint is welcome can help strengthen the child’s ability to succeed because an interpretation of behavior will not only be limited to what teachers feel is true. Really making the effort to include the parent in decision-making processes regarding a child’s education is crucial in supporting students. Teachers can attempt to learn about parents’ ideas about raising their children and determine what ideas each party shares to gain a better understanding of how to respond to the child (Fenton et al., 2017). Knowing how one’s own background influences his or her thinking and determining what is right and wrong may allow teachers and other school personnel to reconsider making rash judgements about students. When teachers meet with parents, they must be intentional about honoring the sentiment that parents are often the ones that know what is best for their child (Fenton et al., 2017).  </p>
                            <p>In a school setting, these ideas can be implemented to build trust among teachers and parents. When teachers attempt to truly learn about families of different backgrounds, they more fully understand the barriers families may face at a systematic level. Upon feeling truly listened to, parents then may become more confident in their ability to navigate the challenges they face when becoming involved in their child’s education (Fenton et al., 2017). When teachers and parents can collaborate, and teachers practice skills of being culturally competent, communication regarding what is best for the student is fostered more effectively.  </p>

                                <p>This is a meta-synthesis of nine studies conducted within 1990-2010 which were found through search of various academic databases. Peer reviewed articles with the terms “parental involvement” and “meta-analysis” yielded the nine studies included (Wilder, 2014). Each has examined the effects of parental involvement as it relates to student academic success. The questions addressed in the synthesis under review are: what findings have appeared among the different studies regarding the effect of parental involvement on academic success, does the lack of a clear definition of parental involvement lead to mixed findings among the studies, and do the methods of measuring such concepts also lead to mixed findings among the studies (Wilder, 2014)? This synthesis seeks to qualitatively address commonalities among studies that examine parental involvement and student success rather than coming to conclusions analytically (Wilder, 2014). Concepts of interest to the researcher were identified and sought out in the articles reviewed.  </p>
                                <p>Wilder (2014) notes that “The most prominent parental involvement components in the analyzed meta-analyses were communication between parents and children regarding school, checking and helping with homework, parental educational expectations and aspirations for their children, and attendance and participation in school activities” (p. 391). The most positive impact on student achievement was when parents exhibited high expectations for their children (Wilder, 2014). For help with homework, there was no positive correlation found for that concept and student success (as cited in Pezdek, Berry, and Renno 2002), and in some cases, there was a negative correlation (as cited in Hill and Tyson 2009; Jeynes 2005). This finding may be explained by the fact that sometimes parents are not well-equipped to provide adequate help with some subjects they may not have extensive knowledge about and that students already struggling with schoolwork are most likely to be the ones that ask for homework assistance (as cited in Patall, Cooper, & Robinson, 2008). This study also found that grade level and race of the student did not significantly alter the effect that parental involvement had on student achievement, which further gives support to the idea that parental involvement greatly influences achievement in a positive way (Wilder, 2014). Though a few studies do show that parental involvement is most influential in the elementary years, this may be due to greater acceptance of such intervention, as older students generally desire an increase in autonomy and therefore parental involvement in schools is not as readily welcome.  </p>
                                <p>This study found the lack of a consistent definition and measure of parental involvement did not affect the positive relationships found between it and student achievement- one suggestion is that when a broader definition of achievement is used, such as student GPA, the relationship between the two variables appears to be stronger (Wilder, 2014). Though parental involvement was consistently related to student achievement despite the measure utilized, the measurement regarded as most effective could not be agreed upon, as different studies concluded varying measurements (using in-class tests, GPA, or standardized test scores and indicators of achievement) showed the best results (Wilder, 2014).   </p>
                                <p>Knowing these findings helps to add to the body of literature that states parental involvement is imperative for student’s success at school. Why some measures of academic achievement yield different strengths of relationships between involvement and achievement is a question to be addressed in future research, as is why parental help with homework is not linked to more positive outcomes for students.  </p>

                                <p>Josie DeShong</p>
                                <p>Carolina Family Engagement Center </p>

                            <p>The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine what forms of parental involvement are most effective for student success in middle school. This article examined 50 different studies from 1985 to 2006 that all investigated the role that parental involvement had in the lives of middle school students. Studies included longitudinal and cross-sectional studies reporting on correlations between parental involvement and academic achievement as well as those detailing the impact intervention programs had on achievement (Hill & Tyson, 2009). The researchers inquired about the extent parental involvement affected student achievement in middle school and which forms of involvement were most effective (Hill & Tyson, 2009).  </p>
                            <p>There are quite a few barriers to parental involvement in the middle school years that are described in this article. Concerns such as the uncertainty of navigating such a large school system and the inability to gain the attention of teachers that are preoccupied with so many students are voiced by parents (Hill & Tyson, 2009). During this time period, students also grapple with gaining a greater sense of autonomy which may lead parents to decrease the amount they are involved in school and home activities (as cited in Prescott, Pelton, & Dornbusch, 1986). Understanding what forms of parental involvement are most useful during this transitionary period in a student’s life is a goal of many researchers who are focused on educational outcomes. Involvement in the home, involvement in the school, and academic socialization are the three modes of involvement of interest to the researchers of this study (Hill & Tyson, 2009). The researchers hypothesize that academic socialization- how parents voice their expectations and ideas about the importance of education- will have a greater positive influence on student achievement than home or school involvement (Hill & Tyson, 2009).  </p>
                            <p>Congruent with the hypothesis, academic socialization yielded the greatest positive correlation with student achievement in middle school (Hill & Tyson, 2009). Involvement in the school was also related to achievement but to a lesser extent, and some aspects of home involvement were also positively correlated with student achievement, but not assistance with homework (Hill & Tyson, 2009). Academic socialization is especially useful during the middle school years because it does not require parents to have a well-established relationship with the teachers to really make a difference in their child’s education; rather, conveying their expectations for their child helps articulate their views on education while also recognizing the child’s desire to find their own way (Hill & Tyson, 2009).  </p>
                            <p>While involvement in the school was positively related to student achievement, this form of involvement might not have been effective for students that did not necessarily prefer their parents to be in the school (Hill & Tyson, 2009). Also, the finding that homework assistance did not positively influence achievement is one that has come up in many other research studies, and one explanation is students already struggling with homework may be the ones soliciting such help and therefore scores on assessments may reflect that struggle.  </p>
                            <p>A takeaway from this article is that academic socialization is a highly effective form of parental involvement during the middle school years. This type of involvement may be more feasible for parents that are limited by time and a lack of resources to become physically present in the school. Further directions on how to build the capacity of parents to use academic socialization to promote student achievement is of interest to researchers.</p>

                            <p>The purpose of this article is to review studies focusing on the importance of establishing early literacy skills and detail strategies that help accomplish this goal. The concepts of phonological awareness and written language awareness have been identified as meaningful focal points in reading interventions (Justice & Pullen, 2003). Phonological awareness is the ability to recognize the sound structure of spoken language and written language awareness details an awareness of the functioning of written language. When parents engage with their children and employ interventions that cater to improving these abilities, enhanced linguistic capabilities can be seen across the years of early childhood. When children come from disadvantaged backgrounds or experience learning difficulties, interventions may prove especially helpful.  </p>
                            <p>Details of what phonological awareness and written language awareness encompass are found in this review. For example, some aspects of phonological awareness include the ability to distinguish letters from words, and words from whole sentences, and knowing that written language is a channel through which ideas are communicated (Justice & Pullen, 2003). Aspects of written language awareness include an understanding that words consist of smaller parts like phonemes and syllables and knowing how to identify words that may rhyme (Justice & Pullen, 2003).  </p>
                            <p>Researchers posit interventions to strengthen early literacy skills must be applied in a natural setting; that is, opportunities to practice skills are most efficient when intertwined into everyday living (as cited in Kaderavek & Justice, 2002). Utilizing evidence-based practices is of importance as well. Using scientifically studied information increases the chances of an intervention having a favorable effect on the outcome variable. Drawing from efficacy studies and effectiveness studies are such examples. Efficacy studies involve an experimental design and ensure high levels of internal validity (the study is scientifically sound), while efficiency studies ensure external validity (findings can be applied across multiple populations) (Justice & Pullen, 2003).  </p>
                            <p>Studies examined have discovered evidence-based reading strategies that assist with early literacy skills. During reading sessions between the parent and child (which are beneficial for developing literacy skills) dialogic reading and print referencing are two strategies that can be employed. Dialogic reading refers to “(a) asking open-ended questions and limiting use of yes/no (close-ended) questions; (b) following children’s answers with additional questions; (c) repeating and expanding on what children say; (d) offering praise, encouragement, and feedback for children’s participation; and (e) following children’s interests” (Justice & Pullen, 2003, p. 103). This helps to create a more engaging conversation between the parent and child during reading activities. Print referencing refers to the action of tracking (following along with the text with one’s finger while reading) and other ways to interact with the text that is physically on the page, such as asking the child which letters are which and what words on the page are similar in some fashion (Justice & Pullen, 2003).  </p>
                            <p>Another useful strategy is to incorporate opportunities for reading into children’s everyday play settings. When items are introduced into a child’s play time, such a list for a scavenger hunt, a book for a child to read to a pretend baby, a menu for a mock restaurant, and other such examples, this greatly enhances children’s engagement in reading as it occurs in a setting that is fun and playful (Justice & Pullen, 2003). Having an adult to direct the use of reading material during play can be helpful as well (Justice & Pullen, 2003).  </p>
                            <p>Finally, being aware of phonological components of words is an important early literacy skill (Justice & Pullen, 2003). While many children grasp this concept without much difficulty, certain programs can be implemented into the curriculum to advance skills in this area. Having lessons specifically tailored to this concept can help when teaching such skills.  </p>

                                    <p>Carolina Family Engagement Center</p>

                            <p>It is known that measuring parental involvement has been difficult due to the complex nature of it. This study seeks to measure parental involvement in the school setting. Coming to an agreement on which characteristics of parental involvement are most salient in the eyes of parents is generally not as difficult as determining the barriers they face to becoming involved (Schueler, McIntyre, & Gehlbach, 2017). Based on the information gathered in preliminary focus groups and interviews, researchers developed three new tools for use with parents: “…an engagement scale, a school invitational barriers sub-scale, and a non-school barriers composite measure” (Schueler et al., 2017, p. 275). How well the scales function in measuring school-based parental involvement and future directions for use are provided.  </p>
                            <p>The researchers attempted to determine how certain scales they used were associated with others in this study. The researchers hypothesized that “…parents facing fewer hurdles are more likely to engage but that many parents overcome barriers, and several parents who experience few barriers still choose not to engage” (Schueler et al., 2017, p. 288). They hypothesized that parents with more time and energy would engage more, although to a certain extent (Schueler et al., 2017). They also hypothesized that a greater liking of the school environment would increase the engagement of parents, and that parents who felt more certain of their ability as a prominent figure in their child’s schooling would be more likely to engage, though possibly at the home level rather than at school (Schueler et al., 2017). Also, researchers assumed parents generally would feel more able to engage when they perceived less barriers (Schueler et al., 2017). </p>
                            <p>Previous research conducted in Chicago showed that sound relationships between parents and teachers greatly contributed to greater academic success of students (Schueler et al., 2017). Initiatives to promote family engagement have not, in the past, been strongly evaluated (as cited in Mapp, 2012). Measuring involvement at the school is not easily done because this means measuring actual behaviors enacted by parents in the school while also taking into account the barriers they face to such involvement (Schueler et al., 2017). Addressing such involvement behaviors may be more feasible than identifying the different aspects of barriers to involvement. A user-friendly survey also needs to be implemented for parents that are often difficult to reach/ are constrained by time limits to involvement (Schueler et al., 2017).  </p>
                            <p>The researchers developed their own scale to measure parental involvement and barriers to involvement. First, the authors reviewed previous research to identify which aspects of parental involvement were most salient and which barriers parents often faced to that involvement. Second, through the use of snowball sampling, citizens were identified to participate in focus groups and interviews regarding what parents thought parental involvement meant. Third, the literature review results and results from the parent discussions were compared so common themes could be identified. This leads to the fourth goal, which was to employ phrases in the way parents would say them. Fifth, the scale was reviewed by professionals in the field of family relationships to ensure agreeance about common themes represented in the scales. Lastly, the scales were tested with a group of parents to make certain each item was interpreted in a similar fashion. Ensuring precision in describing the barriers to involvement (e.g. My work is time consuming vs. My responsibilities are time consuming) allowed for accurate understanding. (Schueler et al., 2017).  </p>
                            <p>Initially, this study utilized 3 focus groups and 1 interview with 12 different parents to gather ideas about parent concerns. Participants were all female, were African American, White, Hispanic, Biracial, and low-income. They employed 60-minute recorded sessions as well with 10 people to gather more data. Also, researchers reviewed relevant literature concerning this topic.  </p>
                            <p>A total of 1,225 participants recruited via SurveyMonkey were the final participants in the study. The participants engaged in the Spring of 2012, Summer of 2012, or Summer of 2013. The participants in the study generally were of higher SES, more educated, and English-speaking in the home than other American citizens as a whole group. This finding was probably due to how study participants were recruited (from an internet website) (Schueler et al., 2017).  </p>
                            <p>The researchers measured 6 engagement, 17 barrier factors in the first study, and 4 engagement and 13 barrier factors in study two, then used the same 4 engagement factors in the third study (Schueler et al., 2017). The “Time and Energy” scale (as cited in Walker et al., 2005), “Satisfaction with the School” scale (as cited in NCES, 2007), and “School Climate” scale (as cited in Schueler, Capotosto, Bahena, McIntyre, & Gehlbach, 2014) were all used in the second study. In the second and third study, the “Parent Efficacy for Helping the Child Succeed in School” scale (as cited in Hoover-Dempsey & Sandler, 2005) was administered. In the third study, the “School General Involvement” scale (as cited in Hoover-Dempsey et al., 2005) was utilized.  </p>
                            <p>Results found that even though some parents reported approving of the school climate, they still were not highly engaged (Schueler et al., 2017). This points to the idea that there are other factors that influence parental engagement. A measure of the study indicated parents that exhibited more self-efficacy were engaged more, which could help explain some of the aforementioned results (Schueler et al., 2017). Results indicate those believing there were less barriers to engage also perceived they had more time and more energy to expend, though there were different levels of engagement even among those perceiving few barriers (Schueler et al., 2017).  </p>
                            <p>Factors leading to parental engagement and also barriers that prevent it are necessary when trying to conceptualize what parental engagement looks like. Developing a scale that measures this sometimes requires the combination of different scales and the use of a composite (Schueler et al., 2017). The researchers tested a combination of scales that can help adequately measure parental engagement while including barriers. The measurement tools developed by the researchers can help school personal gain a clearer understanding of what leads parents to engage as well as identify what factors deter parents from engaging. Having the tools to measure such ideas is helpful because schools can start to think about how to address these concerns. Schools may feel more confident using the scales developed through this study because the scales have been empirically tested.  </p>
                            <p>Though the participants in this study may not completely represent the greater population, much knowledge has been gained about what influences parents to engage more or feel less capable of engaging. Assessing how much variation occurs in different schools could be a goal of future research. </p>

                            <p>The Family Check Up (FCU) model referenced in this article seeks to target parents’ behaviors when interacting with their children so children can develop healthier functioning later in life. Because certain parenting behaviors, such as parental monitoring (as cited in Purdie et al., 2004) and enthusiasm are targeted, children experience an increase in self-regulation, which helps them throughout their development (Stormshak, Fosco, & Dishion, 2010). The researchers “…predicted that self-regulation would be associated with decreased depressive symptoms and increased school engagement during the transition to high school” (Stormshak et al., 2010, p. 4).  </p>
                            <p>While many children are diagnosed with a mental health disorder, a very small amount of those do obtain services to help alleviate the associated issues (Stormshak et al., 2010). Sometimes, behavioral problems present as the result of such issues. There are different programs that have been developed to target problem behaviors in students, but the most effective ones to date include those that specifically aim to change behaviors of the parents to then keep adolescent children from presenting with problematic behavior (as cited in (Brestan & Eyberg, 1998; Connell et al., 2007; Reid & Webster-Stratton, 2001). When parents react to challenges students face in an empathetic way rather than being overly harsh, they can set the stage for better socioemotional growth for their children (as cited in (Pomerantz et al., 2005; Rogers et al., 2009). The Family Check Up model is a “…family-centered, school-based” (Stormshak et al., 2010, p. 2) program that has shown a positive effect on reducing problem behaviors in adolescents, strengthening family functioning, and modifying certain parenting behaviors (as cited in Dishion et al., 2002). The Family Check Up consists of three separate meetings with the guardian of the child to determine what aspects of family functioning need to be adjusted (Stormshak et al., 2010). Parents can keep receiving treatment after the initial three meetings, and treatment can conveniently be delivered by a range of school staff (Stormshak et al., 2010).  </p>
                            <p>Two separate longitudinal, randomized control trials (called Project Alliance 1 and 2) were conducted to determine the efficacy of the FCU model for use with adolescents (Stormshak, 2010). The first study includes individuals who received the intervention during middle school years and are currently in their twenties, and the second study is being conducted with students that are moving on to high school.  </p>
                            <p>Participants included 377 adolescents and their families. The participants were recruited from three different middle schools in urban areas in the country. 277 families were in the treatment group and 100 were in the control group starting in the sixth grade. The students were monitored from sixth grade to ninth grade (four years total). There were almost equal amounts of males and females in the study. 36% of participants were Caucasian, 18% were Latino, 16% were African American, 8% were Asian, 3% were American Indian, and 18% were biracial. Parental income on average ranged from $30,000- $40,000 and the mean level of maximum education level for parents was high school.  </p>
                            <p>The intervention employed in this study consisted of three parts: services offered through a family resource center, the FCU program, and further services should the family choose them (Stormshak et al., 2010). When students were in sixth through eighth grade, they received a questionnaire to fill out that assessed problem behaviors they may have been having. Instruments that assessed the presence of depressive symptoms, self-regulation skills, and engagement in the school environment were given to the students (Stormshak et al., 2010).  </p>
                            <p>Results show that an increase in self-regulation in sixth and seventh graders was positively correlated with school engagement and negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (Stormshak et al., 2010). Intent to Treat analyses, in which “intervention effects are evaluated by comparing the outcomes for all participants assigned to the intervention group with those of the control group, is an appropriate way to evaluate the effect of community-based interventions in real-world settings, as in this study” (Stormshak, 2010, p. 7). </p>
                            <p>Participating in the FCU significantly enhanced levels of self-regulation from sixth to seventh grade (Stormshak et al., 2010). The seventh-grade self-regulation was linked to the decrease in depression from sixth to eighth grade (Stormshak et al., 2010). A surprising finding is that symptoms of depression in eight grade were not related to school engagement in ninth grade, though eight grade self-regulation was related to increased school engagement in ninth grade with a medium effect size (Stormshak et al., 2010). Findings did not vary greatly for male and female students.  </p>
                            <p>he family-centered component of the intervention delivered in the school led to an increase in self-regulation skills for students- these self-regulation skills were positively associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms in students (Stormshak et al., 2010). Increased self-regulation was also associated with increased levels of school engagement, while depressive symptoms were not (Stormshak et al., 2010). Using this type of intervention, self-regulation was strengthened, and therefore school engagement was strengthened as well and depressive symptoms decreased (Stormshak et al., 2010). This study shows the importance of developing self-regulatory skills while making the transition to high school.   </p>
                            <p>Using a family-oriented approach to targeting behavioral and mental health issues in children is useful because it gets to the heart of why many behavioral issues develop in the first place (Stormshak et al., 2010). When family functioning is addressed and children are able to develop self-regulatory skills as a result of living in a more caring environment, the children experience benefits in their mental health as well as willingness to engage in their schooling. The transitioning period from middle to high school may be when children want more autonomy and therefore parents tend to become less involved in the academic life and the monitoring of activities of children, but when a healthy parental role can be established, children can have the guidance they need and also the ability to develop healthy skills to govern their own emotions and behaviors.  </p>
                            <p>This study was determined to be highly efficacious, though the downside is that it may be more difficult in similar settings without government assistance in funding the program and without having all of the components of this study in place (such as the trained consultants) (Stormshak et al., 2010). However, this article sheds light on the benefits of examining family dynamics to improve the wellbeing of children.  </p>
